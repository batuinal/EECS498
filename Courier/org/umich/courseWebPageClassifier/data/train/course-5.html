<p>
There is an abundance of information on the Web on using LaTeX to
prepare technical documents. One well organized collection of links
has been put together by <a
href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~yogi/latex.html">Yossi Gil at the
Technion</a>. If you haven't used LaTeX in the past, you will find it
helpful to go over the relatively simple examples given there, and
then peruse the tutorials on advanced topics.
</p>

<p>We also are providing the <i>extremely</i> brief tutorial below,
that covers just the bare minimum, to get you started.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>File <a href="example.tex">example.tex</a> contains a subset of
essential commands, demonstrated in a simple manner. Download it.
</p>
<li><p>On the CS computer, run the command<br>
<tt>latex example.tex</tt><br>
You will need to run it a couple of times (LaTeX works pretty much
like a compiler, and needs more than one pass to get all the labels,
cross-references etc. right), until you no longer get complains about
undefined references, or warnings that "labels may have changed".
</p>
<p> You will need to have a figure file named <a
href="sin.eps">sin.eps</a>, which you can download from here as well.
</p>
<li><p>
You now have a .dvi file with your document; convert it to PostScript
using the command<br>
<tt>dvips example.dvi -o example.ps</tt><br>
You should get a document that looks like <a href="example.ps">this</a>.
</p>
<li><p>You can create a PDF version <a href="example.pdf">example.pdf</a> in two ways:
<ul><li>Once you have the DVI, run<br>
<tt>dvipdfm example.dvi</tt> 
<li> Or, create PDF directly from LaTeX:<br>
<tt>pdfl</tt><br>
Unfortunately, for this you will need to first convert the .eps
graphics into some other format, e.g. PDF or PNG:<br>
<tt>convert sin.eps sin.png</tt><br>
Note that Matlab can save a figure in many formats, including .eps,
.pdf or .png.
</ul> 
</p>
</ol>
