		<!--<p>	View the previous class's <a href="handouts/AFCB_2011_ClassSummary.pdf">detailed course topics</a> for a sample of teachings for this year's course. Please note that from year-to-year the 
	amount of lectures and homeworks dedicated to specific chapters varies. This year, the course devotes a large amount of time to the topics of (in decreasing order of time spent): (1) algorithmics and statistical theory of 
	genome assembly, (2) BLAST statistical theory, (3) efficient algorithms and data structures for mapping sequence reads, genes, and genomes to genomes, and (4) combinatorial and statistical theory of the DNA sequence regulatory architecture of genes. 
	This is an intensive software coding class for computational science students; as an example, you will build your own genome assembly, BLAST algorithm, HMM for finding CpG islands, and suffix trees. Life science students who are not as familiar 
	with coding will still advance their computational experience through appropriate assignments.</p>
		<p>View the <a href="handouts/csci1820_pillar.pdf">CSCI1820 Pillar Course Summary Slides</a>.</p>-->

 <h2>Who?</h2>
	<p>YOU. The class is open to biologists and computer scientists, applied mathematicians, undergrads and grad students alike. The assignments will be adapted to your skillsets and interests.</p>
	<h2>When?</h2>
	<p>Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:30pm. Spring 2015 semester.</p>
	<h2>Where?</h2>
	<p>CIT 241 The Swig Boardroom nestled into the far corner of CIT's 2nd floor. The whiteboard and presentation amenities are superb, and you can enjoy guest speakers and refreshments on most Wednesdays.</p>
	<h2>What? Computational Biology?!?</h2>
	<p>Computation and biology is a fundamental pairing and most biological research today has a computational component. To put it concisely, computation is a structure that applies mathematical method and logic to problems. Computation benefits from rigorous proof and the capacity to solve complex problems through iteration and/or recursion.</p>
	<p>Biology is perhaps the most suitable science for computational understanding since it consists of many discrete (they either happen or they don't) events occurring in rapid time. Biology needs good statistical approaches and inference methods for discovery and verification of its findings.</p>
	<h2>Why Computational Biology?</h2>
	<p>This one requires a small history lesson and a summary of the field today. Computational Biology takes on very practical dilemmas such as interpreting sequences, modeling molecules, and making statistical prediction. It complements the vast amount of biological data being produced today with a means to make sense of it all. The sequencing of the human genome has given Computational Biology new relevance over the past decade: all of biology is presumed to be explainable from the genetic code.</p>
	<p>If you are a computer scientist, you get to code sequence alignment and genome assembly programs just like the biology gods &mdash; and you'll be solving deep math problems that are very rewarding. If you are a biologist in the class, you will get an appreciation of algorithms (the beautiful, fundamental unit of computer science). And you will be able to bring back new tools to the laboratory. The course focuses on these topics: probability (aka "how to lie with statistics"), sequence analysis, achievements in molecular biology, Hidden Markov Models, the assembly of the human genome, and the study of evolution and mutation.</p>

<!--        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>This  course is devoted to computational and statistical methods as well as software  tools for DNA, RNA, and protein sequence analysis. The focus is on  understanding the algorithmic and mathematical foundations of the methods, the  design of the associated genomics tools, as well as on their applications. A  comprehensive set of programming assignments provides a hands-on journey for  the student into the complexities of real genomic data. These include: basic  components of a genome assembler, mapping sets of sequences to the genome, as  those generated by high-throughput sequencing like Illumina/Solexa and 454, a  BLAST-like search tool, HMM algorithms for gene prediction, suffix trees, motif  prediction for transcription factors promoters, and genome mapping of genetic  variation of SNPs, haplotypes, and copy number. The course has several unifying  themes such as alignment, comparative genomics, protein structure, the newly  unveiled role of RNA in the regulatory genome, and the intertwining of  statistics and algorithmics in the design of powerful genomic tools. </p>

      <p>The course is open to computer and  mathematical sciences students as well as biological and medical students. Both  advanced undergraduates and graduate students are welcome. Biomed students  compensate for programming assignments with comparable work for a final  project. Graduate credit is obtained by a final project devoted to a research  problem. Two grassroots projects are being built gradually by final projects of  students in this class. <em>Genomathica</em> is  a library of biologist-friendly-code-tinkering genomic tools written in  Mathematica, and <em>Cellarium </em>is a  programming language framework for bioinformatics workflows. The instructor  taught evolutionary versions of this course in Departments of Biology, Computer  Science, and Biochemistry and Cell Biology the Medical School).</p></td>
