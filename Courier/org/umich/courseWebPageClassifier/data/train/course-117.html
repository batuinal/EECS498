	<p>Congratulations on finishing Tic! You have all passed the entrance exam to the course :)</p>
	<p>Tac is out! Remember, this is the biggest project in the course (besides maybe your final projects), so allocate time accordingly! Additionally you should sign up for design checks using <code>cs1971_signup tac1</code>.</p>
	<p>Some more important updates:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Banner</strong>: There are lots of spaces on Banner now. If you haven't yet registered for the course, please do so before next Thursday.</li>
			<li><strong>Remember to sign up for Tac1 design checks!</strong></li>

		<h2>Design checks and other stuff</h2>
		<h3>Posted on 04 Sep 2013 by adk</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="post_content">
	<p>Design checks are Thursday 4-6pm, Friday 6-8pm, Saturday 4-9pm, Sunday 4-8pm, in 15-minute slots. Sign up for them using cs1971_signup tic. Seemingly duplicated slots are because there are two TA's at that time. If you can't make any of the design check times, please email the TA list at cs1971tas@cs.brown.edu</p>
	<p>Some more important updates:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>cs1971student group</strong>: You should be in it now. If you didn't receive a [CS1971] email about design checks and still want to take the course, please email the TAs.</li>
			<li><strong>Starter support code</strong> can be found at /course/cs1971/support/starter (just cp -r to your project directory)</li>
			<li><strong>Enrollment cap</strong>: We will be making decisions about this after Tic, but we are prepared to issue overrides to students above the 40 cap. <strong>If you decide not to take the course, please drop it in Banner as soon as possible so that others may sign up.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Remember to sign up for Tic design checks!</strong></li>
