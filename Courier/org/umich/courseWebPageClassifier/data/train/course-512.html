<p><STRONG>Description.</STRONG> 
&nbsp;
This course surveys the most important algorithms and data structures in
use on computers today. Particular emphasis is given to algorithms for
sorting, searching, and string processing. Fundamental algorithms in a
number of other areas are covered as well, including geometric
and graph algorithms. The course
will concentrate on developing implementations, understanding their
performance characteristics, and estimating their potential
effectiveness in applications.

<p><STRONG>Prerequisites.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
COS 126 or ISC 231-234 or approval by the COS placement officer.

<p><STRONG>Traditional lectures.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
Attendance is required.
Laptops, tablets, and phones are prohibited, except for activities directly
related to lecture, such as viewing lecture slides and taking notes.
You are responsible for all material presented in lecture;
some of that material is not covered in the textbook.

<p><STRONG>Flipped lectures.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
As an alternative to traditional lectures, we are offering a <em>flipped lecture</em> option,
in which you watch and tag video lectures online before class and solve problems in class.
Enrollment is limited to 30 students.

<p><STRONG>Precepts.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
We cover details pertinent to programming assignments and exams.
You should come to precept prepared to participate in the discussion,
not just ask questions. 

<!--
<p><STRONG>Orientation precept.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
If you have not taken COS 126, please plan to attend a one-time orientation
at 5PM on Wednesday, February 3 in Friend 006, 
to learn about our conventions for preparing and submitting assignments.
-->

<p><a name="office-hours"></a><STRONG>Course staff.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
You are welcome to attend the office hours of any staff member.
Office hours begin Wednesday, February 4.

<p>The staff is complemented by 
Graduate Student Graders (Bebe Shi and Terry Wang)
and 
Undergraduate Course Assistants (Enric Boix, Dorothy Chen, Christopher R. Hay,
Varun Narayan, Esther Rolf, Utsarga Sikder, Vibhaa Sivaraman, Sara Sun, Victor Xu,
Glenna Yu, and Tiancheng Zheng).

<p>
<strong>Online forum.</strong> &nbsp;
If you have questions about the assignments, lectures, textbook, or other
course materials, please post via
<a href="https://piazza.com/class#spring2015/cos226">Piazza</a>. Posts marked private are viewable only by the course staff.


<p>
<STRONG>Grading.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
Your grade for the course will be based on the following components:
programming assignments (45%), midterm exam (15%), final exam (25%),
exercises (10%), and participation (5%). Participation includes 
using iClickers, contributing to the flipped lectures,
participating in precepts, and answering forum posts.
Occasionally, we make mistakes. To request a regrade, write a brief note
indicating the perceived mistake by the grader;
attach it to your graded work; and give it to your preceptor within
two weeks of when the graded work was returned.


<!-- 
There is no predetermined grade distribution. For example, if you earn 90% (or more) of the available points, your 
grade will be an A- (or better). To calibrate grades across different offerings of the course (e.g., to compensate for 
an exam of unexpected difficulty), we sometimes adjust the cutoffs down (e.g., to 89% for the A- cutoff)
but we never adjust them up.
-->

<p><STRONG>Course website.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
The course website
<blockquote><a href = "http://www.princeton.edu/~cos226">http://www.princeton.edu/~cos226</a></blockquote>
includes links to course content, including programming assignments,
exercises, lecture slides, and old exams.
You will also use it to submit programming assignments.

<!--
<p><STRONG>Video lectures.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
You are welcome to use the video lectures at:

<blockquote>
<a href="https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-003/class">UPDATE TO GUNA'S PAGE</a>
</blockquote>
-->

<p><STRONG>Readings.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
The following textbook is required. It contains a wealth of information 
beyond what we can cover in lecture; it is certain to enhance your understanding
of algorithms and data structures.
<ul>

<p><li>
<em>Algorithms, 4th Edition</em> 
by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2011,
ISBN 0-321-57351-X.
</ul>

<p><STRONG>iClickers.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
To make the lectures more interactive, we will be using
iClickers in the traditional lectures. Any hardware version of the iClicker 
(set to default frequency AA) is suitable. You cannot use 
iClicker GO because the lecture hall has insufficient connectivity.

<ul>

<p><li>
<em>i&gt;Clicker +</em> by W. H. Freeman and Company, ISBN 978-1464120152.

<!--
<p><li>
<em>i&gt;Clicker 2</em> by MPS, ISBN 978-1429280471.
-->
</ul>

<p><strong>Programming assignments.</strong> &nbsp;
The programming assignments involve applying the material from lecture
to solve problems in science, engineering, and commerce.

<p><strong>Exercises.</strong> &nbsp;
The exercises consist of short drill questions on the material in the lectures and readings.

<p><strong>Exams.</strong> &nbsp;
The in-class midterm exam is Wednesday, March 11.
The final exam is 9am on Saturday, May 16.
<!--
The final exam is <a href = "http://registrar.princeton.edu/final-exams/schedule/">scheduled</a> by
the Registar.
-->

<!----
<p><strong>Course calendar.</strong> &nbsp;
You can import this
<a href = "webcal://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall12/cos226/COS226-F12.ics">course calendar</a>
into your calendar application.

<p><strong>Computers.</strong> &nbsp;
You may develop your programs on any machine that you like: we encourage you to
use your own equipment.
We provide instructions for setting up a Java programming environment under
<a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/windows">Windows</a>,
<a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/mac">Mac OS X</a>, and
<a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/linux">Linux</a>.


<p><STRONG>Laboratories.</STRONG>
&nbsp;
Undergraduate 
<a href = "http://labta.cs.princeton.edu">lab TAs</a>
are available to answer general computing questions in the Friend 017 lab.
They can assist you in debugging, provided you have first made a
reasonable effort to identify the bug and isolate the problem.
If you have questions
regarding the course material or programming assignments, see your 
preceptor or instructor.
