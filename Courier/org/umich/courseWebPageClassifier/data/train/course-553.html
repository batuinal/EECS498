  <div class="section"><b>What is this course about?</b>
    What do web search, speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation,
    autonomous driving, and automatic scheduling have in common?
    These are all complex real-world problems,
    and the goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to tackle these 
    with rigorous mathematical tools.
    In this course, you will learn the foundational principles that drive these
    applications and practice implementing some of these systems.  Specific
    topics include machine learning, search, game playing, Markov decision
    processes, constraint satisfaction, graphical models, and logic.
    The main goal of the course is to equip you with the tools to tackle new
    AI problems you might encounter in life.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Prerequisites:</b>
    This course is fast-paced and covers a lot of ground,
    so it is important that you have a solid foundation on both the theoretical and empirical fronts.
    You should have taken the following classes (or their equivalents):
    <ul>
      <li>Programming (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/">CS 106A</a>, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/">CS 106B</a>, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs107/">CS 107</a>)</li>
      <li>Discrete math (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs103/">CS 103</a>)</li>
      <li>Probability (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs109/">CS 109</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Reading:</b>
    There is no required textbook for this class, and you should be able to
    learn everything from the lecture notes and homeworks.
    However, if you would like to pursue more advanced topics or get another
    perspective on the same material, here are some books:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu">Russell and Norvig.  Artificial
        Intelligence: A Modern Approach.</a> A comprehensive reference for
      all the AI topics that we will cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/probabilistic-graphical-models">Koller and Friedman.  Probabilistic Graphical Models.</a>
        Covers factor graphs and Bayesian networks (this is the textbook for CS228).</li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/">Sutton and Barto.  Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction.</a>
        Covers Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning.  Available free online.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/">Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.  The elements of statistical learning.</a>
        Covers machine learning.  Available free online.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.bracil.net/edward/fcs.html">Tsang.  Foundations of constraint satisfaction.</a>
        Covers constraint satisfaction problems.  Available free online.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Bear in mind that some of these books can be quite dense and use different
    notation terminology, so it might take some effort to connect up with the
    material from class.

  <p class="subheader">Grading</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Homeworks</b> (60%):
    There will be weekly homeworks with both written and programming parts.
    Each homework is centered around an application and will also deepen your understanding of the theoretical concepts.
    Some homeworks will have a competition component; winners will receive extra credit.
    Here are all the homework deadlines:
    <p><div id="homeworks"></div></p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Midterm</b> (20%): The midterm is a three-hour written exam that will
    test your knowledge and problem-solving skills on all preceding lectures and homeworks.
    You cannot use any external aids
    except one double-sided page of notes.
    If you have a major conflict (e.g., an academic conference),
    <a href="http://goo.gl/MOzwUL">submit a request</a> to take it at another time
    (do this by <strong>Tue Oct 28</strong>).

    <div id="midterm">
      <blockquote>
        Date: <strong>Tue Nov 18</strong> from 6pm to 9pm</b></br>
        Location: Hewlett 200,201,102,103</b>
      </blockquote>
      
      Midterm solutions:

      </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    For SCPD students, your midterms will be distributed through the SCPD office once you have set up an exam monitor.
    <br /><br />

    </li>

    <li><b><a href="project.html">Project</a></b> (20%): The final project provides an opportunity for you to
    use the tools from class to build something interesting of your choice.
    Projects should be done in groups of up to three.
    The project will be something that you work on throughout the course and we have set up some milestones
    to help you along the way:
    <p><div id="projects"></div></p>
    See <a href="project.html">the project page</a> for more details.
    <p>
    Regardless of the group size, all groups must submit the same basic amount of work as detailed in each milestone.
    Of course, the experiments may not always be successful,
    so we will cut the smaller groups more slack,
    while larger groups are expected to be more thorough in their experiments.
    <p>
    <b><font color=red>Updated:</font>

    <li><b>Piazza</b>:
    You will be awarded with up to 2% extra credit
    if you answer other students' questions in a substantial and helpful way.
  </ul>

  <p class="subheader">Assignments</p>

  <div class="section"><b>Written assignments:</b>
    Homeworks should be written up clearly and succinctly; you may lose points if your answers
    are unclear or unnecessarily complicated.
    Here is an <a href="homework-example.html">example</a> of what we are looking for.
    You are encouraged to use LaTeX to writeup your homeworks
    (here's a <a href="homework.tex">template</a>), but this is not a requirement.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Programming assignments:</b>
    The grader runs on Python 2.7, which is not guaranteed to work with newer versions (Python 3) or older versions (below 2.7).
    Please use <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 2.7</a> to develop your codes.
    <p>
    Although we recommend that you use a UNIX environment (e.g., Linux or OS X),
    the sanity check script <code>grader.py</code> should work on Windows as well.
    <!--(For the first homework assignment, please use
    <a href="https://piazza.com/class/hygyufv6s7i3mu?cid=13">this workaround</a>.)-->
    Note that no matter what OS you use, you will need to submit the assignments on corn machines.
    The final grading will be run on Linux servers.
    <p>
    The submitted code will <b>not</b> be graded if it has one of the following issues:
    <ul>
      <li>The code does not run on <code>corn.stanford.edu</code>.
          In particular, Python packages outside the standard library are not guaranteed to work.</li>
      <li>The code quits unexpectedly. To prevent this, do not use <code>quit()</code>, <code>exit()</code>,
          <code>sys.exit()</code>, <code>os._exit()</code>, or any command that sabotages the server.
      <li>The code reads external resources other than the files given in the assignment.
      <li>The code is malicious. This is considered a violation of the honor code.
          The score of the assignment will be zero (0) and the incident will be reported to the Office of Judicial Affairs.
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Collaboration policy and honor code:</b>
    You are free to form study groups and discuss homeworks and projects.
    However, you must write up homeworks and code from scratch independently
    without referring to any notes from the joint session.  You should not
    copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers from
    previous years' homeworks.  It is an honor code violation to intentionally
    refer to a previous year's solutions, either official or written up by
    another student.  Anybody violating the <a
      href="http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/communitystandards/policy/honor-code">honor
      code</a> will be referred to the Office of Judicial Affairs.
  </div>

  <p class="subheader">Submission</p>

  <div class="section"><b>Electronic Submission:</b>
    All assignments (homework problems and project milestones) must be submitted using the submit script by
    <b><font color="red">11pm</font> (23:00, not 23:59)</b>.
    Please note that the submission script <strong>only works on <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/farmshare/cgi-bin/wiki/index.php/Main_Page#corn_info">corn</a></strong> so please don't submit on <a href="http://www-cs.stanford.edu/computing-guide/overview/computer-systems/myth">myth</a>.
    <p>To submit:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Copy your submission files
        (usually <code>writeup.pdf</code> and <code>submission.py</code>)
        to <code>corn.stanford.edu</code>. You can use a graphical interface
        (<a href="https://itservices.stanford.edu/service/ess/pc/securefx">SecureFX</a>,
         <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>,
         <a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a>) or the following command:
        <pre>scp <span class="placeholder">&lt;your submission file(s)&gt;</span> <span class="placeholder">&lt;your SUNetID&gt;</span>@corn.stanford.edu:</pre>
      </li>
      <li><p>Login to <code>corn.stanford.edu</code>:
        <pre>ssh <span class="placeholder">&lt;your SUNetID&gt;</span>@corn.stanford.edu</pre>
        For Windows, you can use
        <a href="https://itservices.stanford.edu/service/ess/pc/securecrt">SecureCRT</a>,
        <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>, or
        <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.
        Make sure you use the <b>binary transfer mode</b>, as the ASCII transfer mode will damage PDF files!
      </li>
      <li><p>Make sure the code runs correctly on corn. (Otherwise, the code will not be graded.)</li>
      <li><p>Type:
        <pre>/usr/bin/python /usr/class/cs221/WWW/submit.py <span class="placeholder">&lt;assignment ID&gt;</span> <span class="placeholder">&lt;directory with your submission files&gt;</span></pre>
        For example, if the assignment ID is <code>foundations</code>
        and you are in the same directory as your submission files, type:
        <pre>/usr/bin/python /usr/class/cs221/WWW/submit.py foundations ./</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    You are allowed to submit an assignment up to <b>ten (10)</b> times in total.
    Each submission will replace the previous.
    <p>
    Since we do not accept the assignments from other submission methods (e.g., email),
    please make sure you can use the submit script. Do not wait until the deadline.
    If anything goes wrong, please ask a question on Piazza or contact a course assistant.
    <b>Partial work is better than not submitting any work.</b>
    <p>
    You will receive an email confirmation about your submission.  For
    assignments with a programming component, we will automatically
    sanity check your code in some basic test cases, but we will grade
    your code on additional test cases.
    <b>Important</b>: just because you pass the basic test cases, you are by no
    means guaranteed to get full credit on the other test cases, so you should
    test the program more thoroughly yourself!
    <p>
    Unless the assignment instructs otherwise, all of your code modifications
    should be in <code>submission.py</code> and all of your written answers
    in <code>writeup.pdf</code>.
    <p>
    For the project milestones, make sure the <b>same one member</b> of your
    group submits on behalf of the entire group.  The submission should include a
    <code>group.txt</code> file which should contain the <b>SUNetIDs</b> of the entire
    group, one per line. Do not include your names.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Late days:</b>
    An assignment is $n$ days late if it was not turned in within
    $24(n-1)$ hours of the deadline.  You have <b>eight (8) late days</b>
    in total that can be distributed among the assignments (except the project poster
    and the final project report) without penalty, with a maximum of <b>two (2) per assignment</b>.
    The submit script will not accept any submission after the hard deadline,
    which is <b>forty-eight (48) hours</b> after the deadline.
    <p>
    <b><font color=red>(Updated Nov 5)</font></b> If you use more than
    eight (8) late days, we will subtract $(25 n)\%$ from the assignment grade
    where $n$ is the number of late days beyond the 8-day limit.
    Late days are applied chronologically.
    Note that you can still use only up to two (2) late days per assignment.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Regrades</b>:
    If you believe that the course staff made an objective error in grading,
    then you may submit a regrade request.  To do this, you must <b>come in person</b>
    to the owner CA in charge of the given homework or midterm problem.
    Any requests submitted over email or on Piazza will be ignored.
    Remember that even if the grading seems harsh to you, the same rubric was
    used for everyone for fairness, so this is not sufficient justification for
    a regrade.  If the regrade request is valid, the CA will add your request
    to the list, which will get processed.
