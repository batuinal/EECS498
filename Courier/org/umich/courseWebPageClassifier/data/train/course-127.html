	<p>Welcome to CS1950v : Advanced GPU Programming.  This class will assume previous experience with OpenGL / GLSL shaders (ie. from <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs123/">CSCI1230 : Introduction to Computer Graphics</a>).  This course will cover modern OpenGL (4.x) for real time graphics and computation, as well as an introduction to CUDA.</p>
	<h2>Announcements</h2>
    <h3>Fluids is Out</h3>
    <p>The fourth assignment, Fluids is out (a little early).  This project requires you to implemented the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Lagrangian fluid simulation.  There is no updated support code.  You may either modify your previous project or start a new project in the projects folder.</p>
	<h3>NBody-Solar is Out</h3>
	<p>The third assignment, NBody has been posted. The updated support code is not yet ready, but you can read the handout if you're into that kind of thing. Keep an eye out for an email for update instructions, which should be out soon.</p>
	<h3>Warp is Out</h3>
	<p>The second assignment, Warp, has been posted. Please let us know if there are issues with the instructions or support code.</p>
	<h3>Support Code Modification</h3>
	<p>We made some fixes to the stencil code for life on 2/2/2012 at 6PM. If you copied the support code before then and are having problems, try out the new code. We also added some notes to the assignment handout on how to set up cmake and QtCreator.</p>
	<h3>Join the Google Group!</h3>
	<p>We will do the majority of our communication through the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cs195v">google group here</a> so please sign up!
