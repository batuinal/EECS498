    <h2>Large-Scale Networked Systems (csci2950-g)</h2>

    </h3>

    <p>The course will be based on the critical discussion of (mostly)
    current papers drawn from recent conferences. In addition, there
    will be a project component, first on an individual basis and
    then as a class, synthesizing the lessons learned.</p>

    <p>We will explore widely-distributed systems that take advantage
    of resources throughout the Internet.  These systems leverage
    their large size and geographic diversity to provide features like
    bandwidth scalability, rapid responses, massive storage,
    fault-tolerance, high-availability, and diverse data
    collection. <em>We will be particularly interested in understand
    how to make these systems work when the interests of all
    participants are not aligned.</em></p>

    networking and an OS course); or permission of the instructor.</p>

    <h2>Course Credits (tentative)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>PhD: Area &quot;C&quot; (Operating Systems)
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ScM: &quot;Practice&quot; course &amp; &quot;significant
        programming course&quot;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading</h2>

    <h3>Participation (20%)</h3>

    <p>A crucial prerequisite of good systems research is to
    understand the strengths and weaknesses of the existing systems
    and the semantics and requirements of the target application
    domains. Students are expected to contribute to class discussions
    by asking questions, making observations, identifying strengths
    and weaknesses, etc.</p>

    <h3><a href="shortpapers.html">Short-papers</a> (25%)</h3>

    <p>You will critically analyze the papers in the reading list.
    Critical reading of technical papers is a must-have skill in
    research. You will synthesize the lessons for all papers due on a
    given day, compare approaches, assess weaknesses, and suggest
    further research areas.  There are 25 "regular" class days, you
    will write 5 short-papers (approximately 2 pages each). Each will
    be worth 5% of your grade.</p>

    <h3>Presentations (15%)</h3>

    <p>Each student will be making presentations from the reading list
    (the number depends on class size). A week before the
    presentation, the participant will email the instructor a detailed
    outline of the presentation.  Similarly, the talk slides will be
    submitted (pdf) at least two days before the presentation.  The
    outline and slides should be modified on the basis of feedback
    before the presentation.  After the presentation, a page summary
    (html) will be made for the benefit of future students.</p>

    <h3>Individual Projects (20%)</h3>

    <p>The class will begin with two individual projects intended to
    familiarize you with distributed programming and p2p systems.
    Each will be worth 10% of your grade.</p>

    <h3>Group Projects (20%)</h3>

    <p>About 2/3 of the way through the term, we will design a
    complete p2p system, designed to accomodate selfish users.  You
    will contribute to the design, implementation, and evaluation.</p>
