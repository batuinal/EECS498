<h1>(CS/EE 147) Network performance analysis:<br>
An introduction to heavy tails</h1>

<a name="desc"></a>
<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p class="indented">
Heavy-tails are a continual source of excitement and confusion across disciplines as they are repeatedly "discovered" in new contexts. Within computer systems, heavy-tails seemingly pop up everywhere -- from degree distributions in the internet and social networks to file sizes and interarrival times of workloads. However, despite nearly a decade of work on heavy-tails they are still surrounded by confusion within computer science. In this course we will provide an introduction and overview of three main topics about heavy-tails:</p>
<ul>
 <li> Properties: What are heavy-tails? and how are they different than light-tails?
 <li> Emergence: Why do heavy-tails seemingly pop up everywhere?
 <li> Identification: How can heavy-tails be rigorously identified in data?
</ul>

<h3>Course disclaimer </h3>
<p class="indented">
 My goal in teaching this course is to test a new book  I am writing on the topic of heavy tails. So, I will be attempting to hand out a book chapter each week as the notes for each lecture, and the assignments will all be designed to have you all help to test / fill in / polish various aspects of the book. Thanks in advance for your patience!</p>
