This course covers statistical methods for learning a natural language
and applying the knowledge to specific tasks.  Topics include: entropy
and cross entropy of a language, hidden Markov models, Viterbi
algorithm, forward-backward algorithm, trigram models, part-of-speech
tagging, probabilistic context-free parsing, inside-outside algorithm,
learning probabilistic context-free grammars, statistical models of
syntactic disambiguation, statistical anaphora resolution, deriving
semantic word classes from statistical properties, and word-sense
disambiguation.

<p>
Grading is based primarily on the project, and secondarily on the two
in-class, 40 minute, exams.  Class participation will also be considered.
The project is done in groups of 2-4 students.
All groups work on the same project.  Collaboration between groups is allowed
(indeed encouraged), up to, but not including, sharing of code (unless
explicitly authorized in class).  

This semesters project looks at the problem of clustering sentences.

<h4> Sept 18</h5> Read in Stripped Representations.  Find number of words that occur 5 or more times. What sentence includes the ??? occurance of the word "stock". Implemence single-link clustering for word vectors.  How well do the days of the week cluster?
The stripped represetnation for WSJ sections 2-21 can be found in /pro/dpg/cs241/data/train.strip.
