<h2>Overview:</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p class="Body">The goal of this course this semester is to understand the problems inherent in providing next-generation programming tools as part of an integrated development environment or a programming environment (I'll use these terms interchangably.)</p>
  <p class="Body">To achieve this goal we are going to start by considering the purpose of a programming environment, the problems of today's environments, and what an ideal environment should do. Then we will consider different areas in which programming tools and environments can be helpful. For each of these areas we will look at the state of the art and what can and should be done.</p>
