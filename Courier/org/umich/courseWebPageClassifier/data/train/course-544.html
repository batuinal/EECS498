                on Saturday, April 25<sup>th</sup> from 10am - 10pm.  HackOverflow will focus on the use of hardware to build interesting products.
                This particular hackathon is specifically set up to be accessible to those who've only taken CS106A, which means everyone here
                is more than qualified take part.

                <a href="http://wics.stanford.edu">WICS</a> has put together a panel for this Wednesday evening.  The panel is
                designed for undergraduates who are considering a CS major but would like to know more about the CS tracks.
                Here's <a href="http://cs106x.stanford.edu/materials/ecsplore.pdf">a flyer</a> with all of the details, and if you think you're going to make it, you should

                Happy Sunday, everyone.  I hope everyone is having a great weekend.  Several announcements...
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                First, I have conflict with two of the three remaining Thursday office hour blocks, so I've decided
                to just move all Thursday hours to Wednesdays immediately following CS106X lecture.  That means I now
                have office hours on Tuesday from 1 until 4 and on Wednesdays from 2:30 until 5.  
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Second, remember that you have another midterm a week from this Thurdsday evening, once again
                in Cubberley Auditorium from 7 until 10 pm.  The exam will cover everything up through and including
                the material addressed by Handout 31 on tries.  In particular, the moment we finish talking about all things
                tree is the moment we've covered all testable material.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Finally, I've gone ahead and posted working implementations and test frameworks for the
                <tt><b><a href="lectures/hash-maps.zip">HashMap</a></b></tt>, the <tt><b><a href="lectures/tree-maps.zip">TreeMap</a></b></tt>,
                and the <tt><b><a href="lectures/lexicon.zip">Lexicon</a></b></tt>.  Feel free to download and tinker!

              <p>
                I've gone ahead and created a second challenge problem right
                <a href="extras/sharing-chocolate.pdf">here</a>.  It relies on
                your ability to leverage recursive backtracking and memoization
                to solve what was presented as an ACM World Finals Contest Problem
                back in 2010.  (Understand that you problem needs to be super fast
                for all input sizes specified in the problem statement.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Those who solve it will be treated to dinner out with Jerry, TA Kevin,
                and the other students who solved the problem.  Unfortunately, those
                who solved the first problem who also solve this problem can't be taken
                to dinner twice.  (You're still welcome to submit a solution, though.)

                One of my CS110 students built a web application to
                help Stanford students search for and discover new courses.  I've
                been playing with it for a few minutes, and I think it's really
                nicely done.  Check it out at <a href="http://edusalsa.com/">http://edusalsa.com/</a>.

                I need to cancel today's office hours, as I need to be up in San Francisco this afternoon.
                My office hours will resume on Thursday.

                I received word that Google and IEEE are sponsoring a programming competition
                on Saturday, February 14<sup>th</sup>.  More information about the contest

                is a week from tonight, and I'm allowing you to bring in your course textbook, copies
                of the course handouts, your own notes, and copies of your assignment submissions.
                You may not, however, use any electronic devices while taking the exam.

            <li>

                Also, I've gone ahead and posted an advanced programming problem right
                <a href="extras/color-wriggles.pdf">here</a>.  I don't give extra credit
                for completing it, but I will take the first six students to submit an efficient
                solution out to dinner somewhere fancy.

                In a rare display of organization, I've gone ahead and posted the
                <a href="handouts/10-Assignment-2-ADTs.pdf">Assignment 2 handout</a> and the
                <a href="assignments/assign-2-adts.zip">starter files</a>.  (We'll post demo programs

                If you're twiddling your thumbs already, then feel free to tackle the new assignment.

                Remember that you need to state your discussion section time preferences by going
                <a href="http://cs198.stanford.edu">here</a> at some point before
                Sunday at 5:00 p.m.  There's no reward for managing this sooner instead of later, but
                make sure you don't miss the Sunday deadline, else you won't be assigned to a discussion
                section.

                Hey there, CS106X'ers!  If you're reading this, then you're still with us, and that's
                all kinds of awesome.

                Remember that you need to state your discussion section time preferences by going
                <a href="http://cs198.stanford.edu">here</a> at some point between Thursday at 5:00 p.m.
                and Sunday at 5:00 p.m.  There's no reward for managing this sooner instead of later, but
                make sure you don't miss the Sunday deadline, else you won't be assigned to a discussion

                Also, when you get a block of free time, spend that time installing the development
                environment you're required to use for CS106X.  The name of that development environment
                is Qt Creator, and installation instructions can be found right
                <a href="qtcreator.html">here</a>.  The installation process
                requires you download a good number of large files, so it takes a little bit of time.

                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                The first of these three handout houses the larger example I'll start on today and finish
                either today or on Friday.  The second handout is for reference (I won't explicitly cover it
                in lecture), and the third is your very first assignment (due a week from Friday).

                In general, I won't post an announcement every time I'm about to lecture.  You're expected
                to visit the <a href="lectures.html">Lectures</a> and <a href="assignments.html">Assignments</a>
                pages via the tabs and dropdown menus at the top of this page.  You should visit those
