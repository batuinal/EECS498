    <h1>Syllabus</h1>

    <p><strong>Description.</strong> This course is an introduction to computer science in the context of scientific, engineering, and commercial applications. The goal of the course is to teach basic principles and practical issues, while at the same time preparing students to use computers effectively for applications in computer science, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and other disciplines. Topics include: programming in Java; hardware and software systems; algorithms and data structures; fundamental principles of computation; and scientific computing, including simulation, optimization, and data analysis.</p>

    <p><strong>Prerequisites.</strong> None.</p>

    <p><strong>Undergraduate coordinator.</strong> For enrollment problems, contact <a href="mailto:ckenny@cs.princeton.edu">Colleen Kenny-McGinley</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Lectures.</strong> Lectures meet twice a week, on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. There are two lecture sections, one meeting at 10:00am, the other at 11:00. Both meet in Friend 101.</p>

    <p><strong>Precepts.</strong> Precepts meet twice a week, on either Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays or Wednesdays &amp; Fridays. There are <a href="help.html#precepts-table">21 precepts</a> running this semester!</p>

    <p><strong>Readings.</strong> Both of these books are available at Labyrinth Bookstore (<a href="http://www.labyrinthbooks.com/all_detail.aspx?isbn=9780321498052">Intro. to Prog. in Java</a>, <a href="http://www.labyrinthbooks.com/all_detail.aspx?isbn=9780198604426">Computers Ltd.</a>) and <a href="http://library.princeton.edu/libraries/engineering/services">on reserve</a> at the Engineering Library in the Friend Center.</p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>

    <p><strong>This site.</strong> The website you're currently reading contains a wealth of documents and online tools for you to practice and study computer science, including the course lecture slides, online programming activities (with solutions), a Java code visualizer, and an archive of the past ten semesters' worth of exams in this course, also with solutions. A quick way to get back to this page is to type: <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~cos126">princeton.edu/~cos126</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Booksite.</strong> As a reference to the required textbook for this course, we provide <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/">a companion website</a> that has extra exercises and plenty of reference material so you won't have to dig though the textbook for syntax. That said, it is <b>not</b> a replacement for the physical book. The book is the only place to find a detailed explanations of the course curriculum. You will be responsible for a carefully reading of its contents on written exams.</p>

    <p><strong>Piazza.</strong> <a href="http://www.piazza.com/princeton/spring2015/cos126">Piazza</a> is an online forum where you can ask questions anonymously and get an answer from the COS 126 staff rather quickly. You can also read your fellow students' anonymous questions and the staff responses. We recommend reading Piazza a couple times per week to ensure that you are keeping up with your peers.</p>

    <p><strong>Blackboard.</strong> We use Blackboard in this course to distribute course announcements and grades.</p>

    <p><strong>Course software.</strong>This course has an associated software package called <b>introcs</b> that enables students to write and test code. Install it on your computer by following the instructions for your operating system: either <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/windows/">Windows</a>, <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/mac/">Mac</a>, or <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/linux/">Linux</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Novice precepts.</strong> As of Spring 2015, COS 126 is offering two kinds of precepts: those intended for absolute beginners ("novice precepts") and those intended for beginners with some degree of comfort with computational/logical thinking ("regular precepts"). This entire course is designed to be approachable for students with no computing background, but we have found that absolute beginners prefer to have more time to cover the same topics and exercises in precept, so you may choose to register for either 80 minute or 50 minute precepts. If you want to switch from a regular precept to a novice precept, or vice versa, please contact the lead preceptors.</p>

    <p><strong>Cluster computers.</strong>For students who may not have a computer or for students whose computers fail during the semester, we provide cluster machines in Friend Center 017. <a href="docs/cluster-instructions.html">Click here for information on using the labs.</a></p>

    <!--Posts marked private are viewable only by instructors.
    <!--<b>Never post
    assignment code to Piazza</b>. Doing so publicly violates the collaboration policy,
    but even privately it is difficult for us to read large chunks of code in Piazza.
    If your question requires us to look
    at your java file(s), consider office hours, the lab, or this two-step
    approach:
    (1) ask a general question describing your problem;
    (2) if you're still stuck afterwards,
    upload your files to the assignment dropbox and ask your specific
    question in a private post (mention that you uploaded to dropbox).-->

    <h2>Staff</h2>
    <p>COS 126 is taught by a mix of research faculty, teaching faculty, and graduate students. Below you will find our contact information, but please keep in mind that it is <b>almost always more appropriate</b> to post your question on <a href="http://www.piazza.com/princeton/spring2015/cos126">Piazza</a> rather than emailing an individual staff member. Our office hours and precept schedule can be found on the <a href="help.html">"Help!" page</a>.</p>

    <h2>GRADING</h2>

    <img src="images/grade-weighting-pie-chart.png" style="float:right; width:400px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

    <p><strong>Grade weighting.</strong> Semester grades in COS 126 are composed of two two-part exams, worth a combined 50% of the grade, nine weekly programming assignments worth 40%, one final programming project worth the remaining 10, and staff discretion.</p>

    <p><strong>Curve.</strong> We typically do not curve grades in this class. You should expect that the cutoff for an "A" will be approximately 93% of the available points, for an "A-" you'll need approximately 90% and so on.</p>

    <p><strong>Midterm exams.</strong> There are two two-part exams during the semester. One set will be given in middle of the semester, and one set in the last week or so of classes. The exams have a written portion, worth 70% of the exam grade, and a programming portion, worth the remaining 30. There will be no final exam. No makeup exams will be considered without a Dean's recommendation and our preapproval.</p>

    <p><strong>Programming assignments.</strong> There are nine weekly programming assignments all equally weighted.</p>

    <p><strong>Final project.</strong> The final project is a large programming assignment, approximately the length of two weekly assignments. It is due at the end of Reading Period.</p>

    <a name="late-days"></a>
    <p><strong>Late submissions.</strong> The weekly assignments in this course are due on Monday nights at midnight. Submissions made at 12:01am <i>will be</i> marked late. If any part of an assignment is submitted late, the entire assignment will be marked late. Students have four free late days to use as they wish throughout the semester. To use a late day, students do not need to notify their preceptors but they do need to remove their work from Dropbox, our online submission system. Work left on Dropbox will be graded as-is. Students who submit late work after they have used all four free late days will lose 20% of the possible points on the late assignment <i>per day or partial day</i> late thereafter. Outside of this policy, the only late work that will be excused is in the case of medical or personal emergency as indicated by a letter from a Dean, Director of Studies, or from McCosh Health Center. We will not accept any work for this semester after Dean's Date. You cannot use any late days on the final project.</p>

    <a name="extra-credit"></a>
    <img src="images/extra-credit-skeptical-baby.jpg" class="paragraph-illustration">
    <p><strong>Extra credit.</strong> Some of the assignments in this course feature optional extra credit sections intended for students who have completed every other part of the assignment first. In COS 126, extra credit points are only given a small discretionary value at the end of the term. Rather than adding the extra credit points to the total number of earned points in the semester, the course staff considers extra credit for students who end the semester close to a grade boundary, potentially pushing an "A-" to an "A" for example. Note that extra credit sections have stricter collaboration and late policies than the rest of the assignment: Extra credit may not be submitted late under any circumstances. Extra credit may not be discussed, even conceptually, with anyone except your partner and the course staff. Course staff are only permitted to clarify the wording of the extra credit, as we would on an exam question. Staff should not give hints or tips on extra credit nor help debug a student's extra credit code. Students working on a partnered assignment may choose to do the extra credit individually or together. You should decide this <i>before</i> you begin the extra credit.</p>

    <p><strong>Regrades.</strong> If you feel we have made a mistake while grading your work, please write a short note describing the potential mistake and attach it to the graded work. Return it to your preceptor within two weeks of the work being handed back.</p>

    <p><strong>Auditing COS 126.</strong> Auditors must identify themselves to the lead preceptors via email as soon as possible. Auditors will receive only automated feedback on work (i.e., immediate feedback in the submission system, as well as an e-mailed copy of the testing performed on their submissions). To earn audit credit, you must successfully complete all of the programming assignments and the final project (i.e., pass all Dropbox test cases), using at most four late days. Auditors do not take the exams in this course.</p>

    <h2>Collaboration</h2>

    <p><strong>Our plea.</strong> COS 126 is a challenging course that requires a <i>significant time commitment</i> for most students. If you fall behind, please <i>(please!)</i> ask for help! The course staff will be happy to go through any part of the material with you and help you work on your assignments or study for our exams. It takes us more than twenty hours to investigate and prepare each plagiarism case that we bring to the Committee on Discipline. We would <i>much rather</i> spend that time helping you learn the material.</p>

    <a href="http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/03/convictions-of-plagiarism-in-computer-science-courses-on-the-rise"><img src="images/convictions-daily-prince.jpg" class="paragraph-illustration"></a>
    <p><strong>Prosecution.</strong> We actively police every submission made to us for every assignment and exam. We have archives of every imaginable source of solutions to our assignments including many years of Princeton students' past submissions. We compare these results both by automated systems that check for similarities in code structure and by hand. We take no pleasure in bringing cases to the Committee on Discipline, but we will continue to do so if students continue to plagiarize. Part of our job is to keep the playing field level for the vast majority of students who work very hard in this course. For an account of a recent cluster of plagiarism cases in COS 126, see <a href="http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/03/convictions-of-plagiarism-in-computer-science-courses-on-the-rise/">this article in The Daily Prince from Spring 2014</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Ground rules.</strong> In this course you may only receive help from people in the ways described below. You <b>must</b> acknowledge <b>all the help</b> you receive in the <tt>readme.txt</tt> file you submit for each assignment. You are <b>not allowed</b> to post questions about the course or about any of our assignments on <b>any website</b> other than <a href="http://www.piazza.com/princeton/spring2015/cos126">our Piazza page</a>.

    <p><strong>Abetting plagiarism.</strong> Students must keep the work they produce for this course, including code, comments, readme files, and any other work product, <i>absolutely</i> private and confidential. Sharing work with any student, whether that student is in the course or not in the course, is considered <i>abetting plagiarism</i> -- a serious offense prosecuted by the Committe on Discipline.	This policy applies regardless of the method of sharing: whether a student emails his/her work to another student, hands a physical copy of his/her work to another student, posts his/her work to a website or repository where another student can access it, or shares his/her password with another student. This policy applies to finished work as well as to unfinished work, graded and ungraded. This policy applies during the semester as well as after the semester. The course staff maintains an archive of all of work submitted to us in the last ten years. We can and do prosecute students who plagiarize from previous submissions. Students are encouraged to ask the course staff, ideally over Piazza, if they have any reason to be concerned that what they're doing constitutes plagiarism.</p>

      <li>Your work must never be shown or communicated to anyone who is taking COS 126 now or
    who might take COS 126 in the future.</li>
      <li>Abetting plagiarism is a serious offense. Offenders will be reported to
    the Committee on Discipline for investigation.</li>
      <li>You must never place your work in any public location (including websites, leaving printouts in a classroom, etc.). Password-protect your laptop if left unattended.</li>
      <li>You must never give a copy of your work to anyone, except for course staff.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The rules above apply both to finished and unfinished work. They continue to apply even after this semester is over.</p>

    <p>In some assignments, you are given some code to begin with.  
    Like other course materials, you are allowed to read and discuss the 
    original <!--given file-->code with other students, to figure out what it does and how it works.
    But once you make a change to the <!--file-->code, it becomes your work and the rules above apply to it.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Citing allowable references.</strong> Copying or adapting work that is not yours is <b>only permitted if it comes from the course materials</b>. If you do so, you must cite what you used.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> A sample citation:
    <pre>
    /* The formula below comes from "Luminance.java" on the booksite,
       http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/Luminance.java.html */
          return .299*r + .587*g + .114*b;
    </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        It's optional to cite anything that the assignment 
        or checklist tells you to copy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>Reading</i> someone else's solutions (or partial solutions) for assignments (or anything similar to any COS 126 assignment) is not allowed.</p>




    <h3>Peer Discussion</h3>

    <p>You must individually compose your solutions for the course, but some common concerns
    may be discussed with other current students, or publicly on Piazza. Because of the rules above, these discussions must be kept at a general level, without sharing code or other work about assignments. For example, you may ask about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> How to interpret an error message. E.g., "What does <tt>StackOverflowError</tt> mean?"</li>
      <li> Using the DrJava GUI or command-line interface. E.g., "How do you copy text from the Terminal/Command Prompt?"</li>
      <li> The definition of a piece of Java syntax. E.g., "What are the parts of a <tt>for</tt> loop?" </li>
      <li> Clarifying wording in lecture slides, readings, or the requirements specified by an assignment.</li>
      <li> Book/booksite/precept exercises or old exam questions. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Don't let someone be <i>too</i> helpful: it is not allowed for someone to lead you step-by-step
    through any part of an assignment.</p>

    <h3>Help From COS 126 Graduates</h3>
    <p>Anyone who successfully completed COS 126 in a previous term
    is allowed to assist you in the following ways, similar to what a lab TA would do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They may look at your code.</li>
      <li>They must not do any writing or typing (in short, "hands in pockets").</li>
      <li>They may help debug, but they must not give directions on what steps are necessary to complete the assignment.</li>
      <li>They should give thought-provoking suggestions rather than dictating what to change.</li>
      <li>While helping you, they must not look at any other solutions, including their own old ones.</li>
      <ul><li>They can't give high-quality help if they need to rely on a reference. Please seek course staff, office hours, lab TAs or Piazza instead.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>They cannot help with extra credit at all.</li>
    </ul>
    Anybody else (e.g., friends, family, tutors) may help you under these same conditions (provided they are not taking COS 126 now and never will in the future).


    <a name="pair-programming"></a>
    <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
    <p>On certain assignments the collaboration policy is relaxed to allow working with a partner.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work with a partner whose skill level is close to your own.</li>
      <li>
    <img src="images/pair-programming.jpg" class="paragraph-illustration">You <b>must</b> use <i>pair programming</i>: one partner types (the driver) and the
      other reviews the work, identifies bugs, and asks questions (the navigator). Swap roles each 30 to 40 minutes.
      Take breaks from coding to brainstorm and discuss high-level ideas.</li>
      <li>See: <a href="assignments/pairs-kindergarten.pdf">
      All I Really Need to Know About Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten (Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler)</a></li>
      <li><b>All</b> work for that assignment must be done with both of you <b>together</b>, sharing the same computer screen. This includes debugging,
      testing, commenting, writing the readme, and submitting the files online.</li>
      <li>Come to office hours or the lab with your partner. Otherwise you cannot change your code while you visit.</li>
      <li>You should each keep a copy of your final submission.</li>
      <li>To transfer files between partners, you <b>must</b> use e-mail attachments or flash drives. Using file-sharing or pastebin-like webservices is specifically <i>not allowed</i> for security reasons.</li>
      <li>Do not log in to the CS dropbox from your partner's machine, and <b>do not give your partner your CS Dropbox password</b>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If two students begin working on an assignment as partners and cannot complete it together, at least one student must contact the lead preceptor to request a partnership dissolution.</p>


    <h3>Taking COS 126 again.</h3>
    <p> If you took COS 126 (or part of it) before, you may look at your old work but you may <b>not</b> look at the feedback we gave you on your old work. What's more, you may not look at your old work on assignments where: you previously partnered; or you are partnering this time; or you were previously found responsible for plagiarism by the Committee on Discipline. In our experience, students who re-do all of the assignments from scratch are much more likely to succeed in the course, so this is what we strongly recommend.</p>

    <h3>Plagiarism</h3>
    <p>If <b>anything</b> about these policies is unclear during the course, <b>please</b> consult us and ask for clarification.
    Princeton's <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/pub/rrr/">Rights, Rules, Responsibilities</a> handbook asserts:</p>

    <blockquote>The only adequate defense for a student accused of an academic violation is that the work in question does not, in fact, constitute a violation. Neither the defense that the student was ignorant of the regulations concerning academic violations nor the defense that the student was under pressure at the time the violation was committed is considered an adequate defense.</blockquote>

    <p>We use software to compare student submissions. Pairs that are identified as similar are inspected manually by course staff.</p>

    <p>Violators of the course policy will be referred to the Committee on Discipline for review. If found responsible, you will receive an F as a course grade plus whatever disciplinary action the Committee imposes. The typical penalty they impose for plagiarism is suspension from the University for one year.</p>
