<h4>Timeline</h4>

<dl>
<dt>Wednesday, November 22
<dd>Abstract due (two pages).
<dt><font color=red>Sunday, December 31</font>
<dd>Project writeup is due. Up to 8 pages, in <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/conferences/nips06/">NIPS
format</a>. Look for "style files for creating camera-ready papers";
we recommend using LaTeX, but they also provide a template for
Word.<br>
<b>No extensions!</b>
</dl>



<h4>Project format</h4>
<p>The purpose of the project is to focus on a particular topic and
explore it in relative depth. There are three major formats:
<ol>
<li> A <b>survey</b>.
<p> A detailed survey of previous work (as reflected in literature)
on a clearly defined topic. This should focus on a relatively advanced
topic, and therefore probably deal mostly with specialized
publications (journal and conference papers) rather than textbook
material. The survey should compare and contrast a number of
approaches, and not just reiterate points made in each paper. 
<li> A novel <b>application</b> of machine learning.
<p> This should be a non-trivial application. E.g., just taking a
classification problem, applying an arbitrarily chosen classifier and
getting a result (which may be arbitrarily bad) is not an acceptable
project.
<li> <b>Analysis</b> of a machine learning algorithm or model. This
can be empirical (well designed, in-depth study of the behavior of a
model or algorithm which is not obvious) or theoretical, or both. This
broad category includes non-trivial modifications of existing
algorithms. E.g., you may identify a shortcoming in a standard
technique and suggest a way to fix it, leading to improved behavior of
that technique.
</ol>

<p>Projects in the last two categories could potentially lead to a
novel contribution in machine learning and its applications, beyond
this course.</p>


<h4>Write-up instructions</h4>
<p>The writeup should be written as a conference paper. This means
that it should communicate the ideas, methods and (most important)
conclusions concisely, but with enough detail for a reasonably
knoledgeable reader to follow. 
</p>

<p>The project paper must include the following components. 
<ul><li><b>Introduction</b> that clearly states the problem (what it
is, and why it is important and/or difficult), and outlines on an
intuitive level the solution proposed in the paper.
<li><b>Background</b>, briefly describing related work and its relevance,
emphasizing, if appropriate, similarity/differences with what you are doing to solve
the problem. 
<li><b>Technical description</b> of the model/algorithm; this is the main
"meat" of the paper.
<li><b>Experimental evaluation</b>, if relevant. This should be
concise but provide enough information for the results to be
reproduced, with a reasonable effort.
<li><b>Conclusions</b>. This is a very important part. In principle, a
reader should be able to get a good idea what you did and what the
take home message from your work is, by reading only the introduction
and the conclusions sections.
</ul>
</p>

<p>The contents of a survey paper will of course be slightly
different. The introduction in a survey should clearly state the
topic, and outline the main conclusions. The 

<h4>Data sets</h4>
 
The list below is provided simply to give you some ideas of areas in
which there exist interesting data sets. This is by no means an
exclusive list, and you are encouraged to use other data sets and
problems as well.

<ul> Data repositories. These contain many data sets, mostly small
ones, suitable for a large-scale comparative study of algorithms or
for testing a novel algorithm or model.
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/">the Delve project</a>
at University of Toronto
<li> The <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLSummary.html">UCI
ML repository</a> (has pointers to other databases as well)
</ul>

<ul> Specialized data sets in particular areas.
<li> SPAM data sets: The <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/">SpamAssassin data set</a>, the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/">Enron data set</a>.
<li> Handwritten digits: the <a
href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST data set</a>
<li> Object categorization: the <a
href="http://www.mis.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Research/Projects/categorization/eth80-db.html">
ETH-80 data set</a> (simple 8-category object detection task)
<li> A more challenging object categorization task: <a
href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/Caltech101.html">
Caltech 101 data set</a>
<li> Document categorization: the <a
href="http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/">
Reuters-21578 data set</a>
<li> Another document data set: the <a
href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/">20 Newsgroups
data set</a>
</ul>
