<h1 align="center" class="spr_title"><strong>Introduction to Embedded and  Real-Time Software</strong></h1>
<h2 align="center">CSCI1600, MWF 10-10:50, CIT 506</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="spr_body">Embedded and Real Time Programming is a course about creating  software for embedded systems where real-time constraints might be involved.  Most processors today are in embedded  systems.  Cars often involve 100 or more  networked processors.  Computers are  embedded in everything from thermostats to toasters.  Many safety-critical systems, from airplanes  to nuclear power plants, involve real-time embedded systems.  </p>
<p class="spr_body"><br />
  The course itself will teach a combination of theory and  practice.  There will be a semester-long  project which can be done individually or in teams.  There will be two programming assignments,  one emphasizing embedded software and one emphasizing real-time software.  The course will also cover a significant  amount of the underlying theory of real time and embedded software including  modeling, scheduling, and verification.   There may be homework assignments covering these and they will be  covered on the final exam.</p>
<p class="spr_body"><br />
  By the end of the course you should have the satisfaction of  having built an actual embedded system and you will be familiar with the  methods, techniques, and terminologies associated with real time and embedded software.  You will also learn about hardware (real  hardware that involves things like resisters and capacitors as well as logic  circuits), operating systems, and other related topics.</p>
<h2>Course Mechanics</h2>
<p class="spr_body">The text for the course is <strong><em>Introduction to Embedded Systems</em></strong> by Edward Lee and Sanjit Seshia.  This  text is available both at the book store and on-line at <a href="http://leeseshia.org" class="spr_body">http://leeseshia.org</a>  as a <strong><em>free</em></strong> download. </p>
<p class="spr_body"><br />
We will be going through most of the text.  However, the text is more oriented toward a  theoretical course while we are going to be teaching a more practical one. In  order to let you start on the final project and the programming assignments  early on, we will be going through the text in a semi-random order.  Assignments from the problems in the text  will be used as appropriate and if needed.   (Even if they are not assigned, you are encouraged to look at and  understand the assignments since being able to complete them will be helpful  when taking the final.)  The various  readings are noted in the schedule as are the topics, assignment due dates, and  project due dates.  All items here are  subject to change.</p>
<p class="spr_body"><br />
We will also cover some material that is outside of the  text.  Much of this will be practical  (e.g. how to use an Arduino; reading and understanding circuit diagrams), but  some will be theoretical material not in the text that is useful for  understanding embedded systems (e.g. queuing theory, fault tolerance and  security).  </p>
<p class="spr_body"><br />
  We will provide hardware for doing the assignments.  You are free to purchase your own hardware as  well.  If the hardware is provided by  Brown, you are responsible for returning it at the end of the course so it can  be used again the next time the course is taught.</p>
<h2>Project</h2>
<p class="spr_body">Much of the course will involve a student-chosen project that  involves real-time and/or embedded software.   This project can be done either individually or in teams.  The project schedule is roughly:</p>

  </table>
</div>
<p class="spr_body">You can either have the department purchase the hardware for  your project or you can purchase it yourself.   If the department purchases it, then you are responsible for returning the  equipment in usable shape.<br />
  Projects can involve anything you are interested in, ranging  from wearable clothing to music processing to games to intelligent appliances  or devices.  Projects may (but need not)  involve a real-time component.  We will  discuss project scope and limitations in class.</p>
