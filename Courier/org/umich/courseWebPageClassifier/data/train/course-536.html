<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>Many problems we want to solve are often NP-hard or worse, but somehow, they need to get solved anyway. What can we do? Over the years, multiple paradigms for coping with NP-hardness have been introduced: for instance, approximation algorithms, average-case analysis, and randomized algorithms were all borne out of a desire to solve hard problems by relaxing the problem or strengthening the model. 
</p>

<p>
Within the last 20 years, a new paradigm has been introduced, where one measures the time complexity of an algorithm not just in terms of the <i>input length</i> but also a small side 
<i>parameter</i>. A priori, the parameter can be anything, but the interesting case is when complex instances of the problem still have relatively small parameter values. The overall goal is to identify interesting parameterizations of hard problems where we can design algorithms running in time polynomial in the input length but possibly exponential (or worse) in the small parameter. Such an algorithm is called "fixed-parameter tractable" and it is the gold standard for parameterized algorithms. 
</p>

<p>
This is a subject which is still very new and fresh. Although many papers on the subject appear in the top theory conferences each year, there are few systematic courses within the United States. We will attempt to correct this. Parameterization has become an important topic that has bearing on other strands of theory as well (including circuit complexity). The course will be heavily research-oriented with lots of open problems, and it will introduce you to new ways of thinking about existing theory. 
</p>

<b>Workload for this course:</b>  

<ul>
 <li> A few large problem sets, about two weeks apart.
 <li> In-class presentation on a topic of interest related to the course, or on your own research! 
 <li> You may be asked to scribe a lecture in LaTeX.
</ul>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> This is technically a graduate course, but it is open to anyone. You should probably have had CS154 (undergrad automata) and CS161 (undergrad algorithms) or their equivalents -- otherwise, the course may be tough to follow in some places. We will try to recall the concepts needed along the way. There is no textbook for the course, but we will catalogue some reading material found on the web as we go.

<h3> <a name="presentations">Papers for presentations</a></h3> 

You may pick one or more papers to present, or you may present your own work, if it falls within the scope of the course! Email Ryan with what you decide (first-come, first-serve); the deadline will be posted later. We currently expect your presentations to be at most 30 minutes long (note this estimate will only go down... it won't go up!).
<br>The papers that have already been claimed will be crossed out.
