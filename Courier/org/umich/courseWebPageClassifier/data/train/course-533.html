	<br>For more information, click <a href="https://stanford.coursera.org/cs157-001/forum/thread?thread_id=19">here</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:cs157-aut1415-staff@lists.stanford.edu">cs157-aut1415-staff@lists.stanford.edu</a>. 
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">
	<p>The <b>mid-term</b> for CS157 will be held on Thursday, October 23, 2014 during class hours.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This year, we are continuing our experiment with an "inverted classroom" approach to CS157.  All of the material of the course will be provided online as <b>two</b> identical Coursera courses. Both of these courses are open for enrollment and go live on Monday, September 29, 2014.  
<ul>
	<li style="text-align:justify;"><b>Stanford-only offering</b> of the course can be accessed using the link: <a href='https://stanford.coursera.org/course/cs157'>https://stanford.coursera.org/course/cs157</a>. All students who are enrolled in CS157 <b>MUST sign up</b> for this course and <b>submit</b> their assignments in this version of the course for their grades to be recorded. When you visit the above link, you'll be prompted to log-in through Stanford University ID / email.  Unless you submit assignments on this page, your <i>grades</i> will not recorded.

	<li style="text-align:justify;">In addition, there is an offering of the course that is open to <b>everyone</b> (including non-Stanford students). Link: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/intrologic">https://www.coursera.org/course/intrologic</a>. Although you are not required to, we encourage you to sign-up for the public Intrologic course anyway in order to access the discussion forums.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</p>
 
<h3>Class and Office Hours</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On <b>Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2:15 pm - 3:00 pm</b> we will hold live discussion sessions in <b>Gates 219</b> (also called the Gates 2A Open Space) and offer personal communication for those of you who want to discuss the material. Our experience suggests that, for most of you (maybe all of you), this format is likely to be superior to the traditional lecture model of education. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">These sessions are optional but are highly encouraged. Drop by if you have any questions or just want to talk about the material. There will be <i>no formal presentations</i> in these sessions.  We will be there just to answer questions and to discuss any and all matters related to Logic). SCPD Students are welcome to attend these sessions. If you <i>cannot attend</i> and have questions, feel free to <a href="http://cs157.stanford.edu/people.html">email us</a> of us with your questions.  If necessary, we may arrange for times to communicate by phone or video-conference or host private office hours.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Your Stanford grade will be based on the following. 
<ol>
	<li>Your performance on the online problem sets.</li>
	<li>Your performance on an in-class midterm and final exam.</li>
</ol> 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are approximately 70 problems in the online portion of this course, and your grades on these problems will affect your overall grade for the course. In particular, it will count for 50% of your overall grade. The other 50% will be based on the offline midterm and the offline final exam. 

<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">CS 157 is a rigorous introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences.  It shows how to reason systematically with such information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical conclusions.  It examines logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.</p>
