            <h2> Welcome to CS123! </h2>

            <p>
                This course offers an in-depth exploration of fundamental concepts in 2D and 3D computer graphics. After introducing 2D raster graphics techniques, the course focuses on 3D modeling, geometric transformations, 3D viewing and rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
                A sequence of assignments in C++ culminates in a simple geometric modeler and ray tracer. Meanwhile, a sequence of labs introduces real-time rendering with OpenGL. Students finish the course by building a demo scene using modern OpenGL techniques.
            </p>

            <h3> Prerequisites </h3>

            <p>
                Undergraduate students taking this course are expected to have completed any intro sequence (15/16, 17/18, or 19), and should also have taken CS32, or have strong software engineering skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the course is targeted at juniors, sophomores who did well in the intro sequence and have strong programming skills are able to take CS123. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Graduate students are also encouraged to take this course; graduate credit is obtained by completing the additional half credit requirements found in most projects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior knowledge of C++ or linear algebra is helpful, but not required to take CS123. Students not already familiar with these concepts are encouraged to attend helpsessions that will be provided during the semester.
