<h3>MOTD</h3><br>

<h3>What?</h3><br>
<p>This course provides a systematic introduction to machine
learning, covering theoretical as well as practical aspects of the use
of statistical methods in artificial intelligence. Topics include
linear models, support vector machines, regularization theory, and
graphical models. Application examples are taken from areas like
information retrieval, natural language processing, computer vision
and others.
</p>

For a more detailed description of the course see the <a
href="syllabus.html">Syllabus</a> page. An up-to-date repository of
course material, <b>including lecture slides</b>, is kept on the <a 
href="calendar.html">Calendar</a> page.

<h3>Course policies</h3> 
<p>
<b>Grading:</b> There will be six homework assignments, each worth 10% of the
final grade. In addition, there will be two in-class exams: a midterm
(15% of the grade) and a final (20%). The remaining 5% will be
determined by the teaching staff based on class participation.
</p>

<p>Some discussion among students regarding homework is
encouraged. Appropriate discussion focuses on understanding the
relevant material, and exchanging ideas on how to approach a problem
-- not direct cooperation on solving the homework.
In the end each student should do all the homework problems and submit her/his
own solution.
</p>

<p>
<b>200-level credit</b> will be given for an individual final project. Projects
will consist of either design and implementation of a machine learning
solution for a practical application, or an in-depth investigation of
a machine learning topic. We will suggest some problems, but students
will also be encouraged to suggest other problems that interest
them. The main outcome will be a write-up in the style of a conference
paper, with emphasis on motivation and discussion.
