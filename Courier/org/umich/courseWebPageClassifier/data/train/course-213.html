<i>Reading from the <a href="http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439810712">textbook</a> due Wednesday, September 19:</i> page 1; pages 7-9 (section 1.1.3 but stop before 1.1.3.1.3); and pages 36-59 (section 1.2 to the end of the chapter). Feel free to skim section 1.1 if you feel you want more detail about why proteins are important for life, but it gets bogged down in a lot of chemistry that really doesn't have much to do with protein folding.
