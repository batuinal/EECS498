<h2>Course Summary</h2> 

<p>Understand the design and construction of compilers. Concepts
include syntactical analysis, semantics, code generation, optimization, and
run-time systems.  Problems in processing imperative languages, such
as C and Pascal, as well as functional languages such as ML, will be
examined. A complete compiler for a small language will be implemented
in C++ and LLVM.  </p>

<p>Prerequisites: 217 and 226.</p>

<H2><a name="grading">Grading</a></H2>

Your grade will be calculated as follows (with adjustment for quizzes and participation):
<ul>
<li>standard programming assignments (1-7): 50%
<li>midterm exam and final exam: 50%
<li>participation: EC
<li>quizzes: EC
</ul>

<p>The final exam is worth twice as much as the midterm.</p>

<h2><a name="exams">Exams</a></H2>

There will be a midterm exam and a final exam.  The exercises at the
end of each chapter of <a href="/~appel/modern/ml"><em>Modern Compiler 
Implementation in ML</em></a> are representative of the questions that will 
appear on the exam.  The best way to study for the exams is to do these 
exercises.
<BR>
<H2><a name="assignments">Assignments</a></H2>

There will be 6 weekly or biweekly programming assignments.

<!--The assignments are (mostly) due Mondays at midnight.-->  You can get help with the
assignments by posting questions to 
<a href="https://piazza.com/princeton/spring2015/cos320/home/">
Piazza</a>, or by calling or visiting Professor
August or the teaching assistant.  Ask for help when you need it!
<p>

The late policy is to encourage submissions that are on-time.  Any 
project can be late for up to 3 days without penalty.  Up to 7 days total 
may be used during the semester, so use your late days wisely.  After 3 
days, zero credit is given for the
assignment.

<p>

There will be no extensions due to scheduling conflicts, computer
downtime, or other such factors, except under truly extraordinary
circumstances.  Extensions will be granted only for
university-sanctioned excuses such as illness, and then only with the
proper documentation.  You are responsible for planning ahead and
managing your time so that you can complete the assignments on time.
You must either finish on time or accept the consequences of doing
otherwise.

<p>

Penalties are waived only for unforeseen circumstances, like illness,
and then only with an appropriate written excuse.<p>

Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process.
Individuals must reach their own understanding of the problem and
discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with
friends are encouraged.  However, when the time comes to write the
code that solves the problem, such discussions are no longer
appropriate - the program must be your own work (although you may ask
teaching assistants for help in debugging).  If you have a question
about how to use some feature of C++, UNIX, etc., then you can certainly
ask your friends or the teaching assistants.<p>

<strong>Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's
program</strong>.  Writing code for use by another or using another
code in any form violates the University's academic regulations.<p>

<H2><a name="submit">Submitting Programming Assignments</a></H2>

Submit your solutions to the programming assignments electronically using dropbox.
Details will be provided for each assignment.
