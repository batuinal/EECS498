					<p>
						Welcome to CS15, one of the introductory computer science courses offered at Brown University!
					</p>

					<p>
						CS15 introduces students to the field through object-oriented design and programming, using Java. It reinforces concepts with practical exercises in weekly lab sessions and with challenging and engaging programming assignments, such as Doodle Jump and Tetris!
					</p>
					<p>
						There are no prerequisites for CS15 and the course expects no prior programming experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						Go to <a href = "onlineta.html"> Online TA </a> for information on coding conventions and compiler errors.

							<h4>Helpful Handouts</h4>
							 Two handouts have been uploaded on the <a href = "onlineta.html"> Online TA </a> page.
							 The one on variables and constructors should help with figuring out concepts such as initialization vs instantiation, when to store values in variables, and so on. The one on Runtime Errors can help you debug errors that happen when your program is running.

							<h4>Registration Form</h4>
							If you plan on taking the course, fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/brown.edu/forms/d/1wRFGybI2W6nco6S-1jZQsf4GmAmT-2mNO_9x-jWicac/viewform?usp=send_form">registration form</a> as soon as possible, so we can get a CS department account made for you. If you are not a Brown student but want to take the course, please <a href = "mailto:cs015headtas@cs.brown.edu">contact the HTAs</a>. If you are a Brown student and get a permission denied when trying to access this form, you are not  signed into your Brown account on Chrome (the form is restricted to those with a brown.edu address). There are two ways to fix this. One is that you could sign out of your personal gmail account on Chrome (not just your email) and switch to your Brown account then try clicking on the link. If you don't want to do that, simply open up an incognito window, click on the form and then sign in with your Brown credentials.
