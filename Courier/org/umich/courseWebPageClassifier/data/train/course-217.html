</title><br>
<h1>Topics in Advanced Algorithmics: Algorithmic Game Theory, 3D Computational Geometry, Quantum Computing</h1>
<br>
<h4>
<ul>
<li>
Who:
Claire Mathieu and Franco P. Preparata</li>
<li>
When: MF 1:30-2:50
</li>
<li>
Where: CIT 506
</li>
<li>What: The first half of the course (up until Spring break) will be on connecting computer science to economics:
 introduction to mechanism design, 
 combinatorial auctions, 
 computational efficiency in mechanisms, 
 profit maximization, distributed aspects, cost sharing, and online mechanisms.
The second half of the course consists of two topics in algorithmic theory: 3D-computational geometry, its model and foundations, convex hulls, intersection, proximity; introduction to quantum computing, foundations, networks, notable algorithms, and a critical review.
</li>
<li>Evaluation: There will be one numerical grade for each half of the course, 
then the two grades will be reconciled by the two instructors into a final letter grade.
Each student can choose whether they want a letter grade or prefer S/NC.

<a href="http://blog.post.edu/2011/05/ex-post-facto.html">Here</a> is how it will be.

<h3>Assignments:</h3>
<li> <a href="CSCI2951Jassignment1.pdf">Assignment 1</a> due Feb 4 at 1:30pm.
<li> Assignment 2, handed out in class, is due Feb 18 at 1:30pm, say.
<h3>Office hours:</h3>
M 3-5, CIT 555 and ("and"? Or is it "or"?) by appointment.

<h3>Schedule:</h3>
<li>Class on Wednesday 2/13 at 1:30pm, root CIT Library (4th floor) to make up for Friday 2/8 snowday.
<strong><FONT COLOR="FF0000">W 2/13</FONT></strong>
<li>First class at a special time, 
On Wednesday 1/23 at 1:30pm, room CIT 506. We covered: 
Book chapter 1 sections 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.4, 1.3.1, 1.3.3, 1.3.4, and 1.3.5. (did not finish the proof, which is not in the book)</li>
<li> The second class will be on Friday 1/25 at 1:30pm. 
Please read section 1.3.5 before then so that you can follow the end of the proof.</li>
<li>There will be <strong>no class on 1/28 and 1/31</strong> (Claire is at a conference).</li>
<li>To make up for it, on the week of 2/3 there will be three classes instead of two, 
on M 2/4, <strong><FONT COLOR="FF0000">W 2/6</FONT></strong>, and F 2/8. </li>
