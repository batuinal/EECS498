<h1>(CS/EE/CMS 144) <br>Networks: Structure & Economics</h1>


<h3>Course details</h3>
<p class="indented">
The course meets MW 9-10:25am in Annenberg 105. <br>
We will often have ``makeup'' and ``bonus'' lectures on F 9-10:25am in Annenberg 105.<br><br> 

The course will be managed using Piazza.  All communication will happend and all materials will be posted through <a href="http://piazza.com/caltech/winter2015/cseecms144">http://piazza.com/caltech/winter2015/cseecms144</a>. Email Adam if you have problems enrolling yourself at the site.

<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p class="indented">
Social networks, the web, and the internet are an essential parts of our lives and we all depend on them every day, but do you really know what makes them work? This course studies the "big" ideas behind our networked lives. Things like, what do networks actually look like (and why do they all look so similar)? How do search engines work? Why to memes spread the way they do? How does web advertising work? For all these questions and more, the course will provide a mixture of both mathematical analysis and hands-on labs.<i>This course can be combined with CS/EE 145 and CS 141a or CS/EE 143 to satisfy the project requirement for CS undergraduate degree, but CS/EE 143 and CS 141a are not required prerequisites. The course assumes students are comfortable with graph theory, probability, and basic programming.</i></p>

<h3>Required Textbook</h3>
<p class="indented">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Networks-Crowds-Markets-Reasoning-Connected/dp/0521195330">Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World</a>,<br>
by David Easley and Jon Kleinberg. <br><br>
This book is quite reasonably priced, but there is also a pre-publication pdf available <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/">here</a>.  I think the book is excellent, so I highly recommend you buy a copy and read it cover-to-cover.  We will not be going through it in order, but I will point to the relevant parts of the book for each lecture. Additionally, I will post course notes and supplementary papers on this site at the end of each class.
</p>


<a name="lectures"></a>
<h3> Lectures</h3>

<p class="indented"> This is only a tentative outline of the topics we will discuss and will likely change as the term goes by.  But, I put it up to give you an idea of where we're going. The course is basically organized as a collection of topics that I think are important and interesting and which provide a modern perspective on our networked lives. <br><br>
<!--<b> Note: </b> I am posting my slides and handwritten notes for each lecture, but they are incomplete and certainly are not meant to serve as a replacement for attending class.  I typically dovetail powerpoint and boardwork together, so the notes and slides should be looked at together.<br><br>-->

<a name="grading"></a>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p class="indented">This is a preliminary breakdown that may change during the term.  In particular, I reserve the right to decide that I want to have a final, in which case it will change dramatically! <br>

<p class="indented">
<ul>
<li> Homeworks -- 70%
<li> Blog posts -- 10%
<li> Project proposal -- 10%
<li> Project plan -- 10%
</ul>
-->

<a name="homeworks"></a>
<h3> Homeworks </h3>
<p class="indented"> Homeworks will be assigned every 1-2 weeks.  Many of the problems will be challenging, so please start immediately and please come to office hours to discuss the problems! The assignments will represent a mixture of theory (proofs) and practice (coding).  I assume that you can code and use Matlab/Mathematica and Python.<br><br>

<!--You are strongly encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on these problems, but each person must write up the final solutions individually.  You should note on your homework specifically which problems were a collaborative effort and with whom.  <br><br>-->
</p>

<ul>
<li> Homework 1: Warming up</p>
</li>
<li> Homework 2: Starting with a crawl
</li>
<li> Homework 3: Heavy tails and small worlds
</li>
<li> Homework 4: Search & MapReduce
</li>
<li> Miniproject 1: Rankmaniac
</li>
<li> Homework 5: Game theory warmup
</li>
<li> Minproject 2: Pandemaniac
</li>
<li> Homework 6: Auctions and sponsored search
</li>
<li> Miniproject 3: Clickmaniac
</li>
<li> Homework 7: Network Economics
</li>

</ul>

<!--
<p class="indented"><br> <b>Late policy:</b> Assignments are typically due Fridays at 1pm. I will allocate each student 4 tokens at the beginning of the term.  Each of these tokens can be used to buy a one day extension on any homework during the term.  You cannot get extra tokens and zero credit will be given to late assignments, so use your tokens wisely and start early!</p>

<a name="blog"></a>
<h3> Blog Post Guidelines </h3>

<p class="indented"> We will maintain a <a href="http://cs144-caltech.blogspot.com/">CS144 course blog</a> as part of the course, with the goal of ensuring that everyone takes the time to connect what we are discussing in class with what's going on in the world.  Every student will be responsible for making two posts during the term.  The deadline for these posts is rolling, depending on your last name. <a href="blogpolicies.pdf">The details of the policies, grading, and due dates for these blog posts is here.</a> <br><br>

Pretty much anything related to "our networked life" is an appropriate topic for posts.  Possibilities range from (i) topics related to the robustness, structure, growth of networks broadly defined; (ii) anything about the interaction of networks with economics or markets; (iii) topics about what runs the web (data centers, cdns, etc); and (iv) topics related to how fads, opinions, or political movements spread.    For inspiration, check out the <a href="http://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/">course blog from the Cornell "Networks" course</a>. <br><br>

To allow students to make posts anonymously (if desired), we have a common userid and password, which will be announced in class.  If you missed it, or forgot it, email a TA.  To allow for grading, if you post anonymously please be sure to email JK "claiming" your post.</p>



<a name="projects"></a>
<h3> Project Information</h3>

<p class="indented">
We will not be having a course project during this term, but those doing the project sequence (143/144/145) will be preparing for the project they will complete during the third term.  To accomplish this we will have two project-related assignments:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="projectproposal.pdf">Project proposal</a> (due: Feb 22 at 1:30pm)<br>
<p>
You will provide 1-2 page proposals for 3 possible projects related to 144 (or 143).  These can be completed in groups of 2-4. We will provide more detail and guidance on possible areas soon, but this is meant to be very open ended. <b>Even those not doing the project sequence will be required to submit proposals. </b>

We hope that you consult with the TAs and/or the professor about your ideas before the deadline of the project proposal.  This will allow us to suggest ideas if you're stuck or give early feedback/pointers related to ideas you are considering. <br><br>

Those not taking the project sequence will still be required to submit project proposals -- this is because I think this is an excellent exercise that forces you to think creatively about the material in the course. <br><br>

If you're having trouble coming up with a good idea for a project, here are some possible places to start looking:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs145/">Past student projects</a>
<li> Yahoo's <a href="http://labs.yahoo.com/ksc">key scientific challenges</a>
<li> Interesting network data sets: <a href="http://www.nndb.com/">NNDB</a>, <a href="http://theinfo.org/get/data"> theinfo.org</a>, <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/">Mark Newman's repository</a>, <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/">Jure Leskovec's repository</a>
      </li>
<li> Research papers: <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs685/2007fa/">Jon Kleinberg's course</a> has a nice list
<li> The chapters we haven't covered in <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/">[Easley & Kleinberg]</a>
<li> Web applications: Facebook apps, twitter, digg, capthcas, prediction markets, ebay, iphone/android apps, etc...
<li> Mung Chiang's <a href="http://scenic.princeton.edu/network20q/">20Q about networked life course website</a>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example <a href="proposals.pdf">project proposals report</a> to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.  (You only need to do 3, they just did 6 because they were enthusiastic!)
</p>
</li>

<li><a href="projectplan.pdf">Project plan</a> (due: March 16 at 1:30pm) <br>
<p>
At the end of the course, those doing the project sequence will provide a 5-10 page detailed proposal including a literature review and timeline for the project that they will pursue during the spring term.  Again groups of 2-4 are preferred. Those not doing the project sequence will instead be asked to design a new ``course module'', including 1-2 lectures and a few homework problems.
<br>
<br>
Here's an example <a href="module.pdf">course module</a> and <a href="plan.pdf">project plan</a> to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.  (For the module, you can also turn in annotated ppt slides if you prefer.)
