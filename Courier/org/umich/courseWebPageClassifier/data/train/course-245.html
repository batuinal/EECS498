<p><b>NOTE:</b> Before you email us a question, first read the entire page
below.  If you still have a question, check to see if your question hasn't
already been answered on the <a href="./faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQ)</a> page.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We break <a href="overview.html">CS 11</a> into several "language tracks."
Not every track is taught every term.</p>

<p>This term, we are asking students to sign up for language tracks online.
Please go to the Caltech Moodle page <a
href="http://moodle.caltech.edu">here</a>, follow the links to the CS 11 page,
and fill it out the signup questionnaire as soon as possible.  The enrollment
key was given out at the organizational meeting (email us if you need it).
Students intending to do a CS 11 project track should also fill out the signup
questionnaire.  The signup questionnaire assumes that you have a working CMS
cluster account (you'll need to enter your login name); if not, you should apply
for one <a href="http://acctreq.cms.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/request.cgi">here</a>,
and fill in the questionnaire when your account has been set up.</p>

<p>Here are the tracks being offered this term (incomplete):</p>

<p>Alternatively, many students choose to pursue independent projects in
programming:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    See the <a href="material/projects/index.html">CS11 Project Page</a> for
    details about how projects are currently run.

<p>We hold office hours on a weekly basis.  You can come and get
one-on-one help during these times.  Of course, you're welcome to send
email to us and arrange a personal meeting at any time.</p>  

<p>Our office hours are currently:</p>

<blockquote>
<table border=1 bgcolor="#eeeeee" summary="office hours">
<tr><td><i>day</i></td><td><i>time</i></td><td><i>who</i></td>
<td><i>where</i></td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Tuesday</td>
<td>2-4 PM</td>
<td><a href="mailto:mvanier@cs.caltech.edu">Mike</a></td>
<td>Annenberg 110</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Wednesday</td>
<td>2-4 PM</td>
<td><a href="mailto:donnie@cms.caltech.edu">Donnie</a></td>
<td>Annenberg 111</td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>All students in CS 11 should have an account on the CMS cluster.  If you
don't have an account, please apply for one <a
href="http://acctreq.cms.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/request.cgi">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not registered in CS 11 but want to add the class before add
day, please read <a href="./adding.html">this page</a>.</p>


<hr/>

<h4><b>NOTE:</b> CS 11 TAships</h4>

<p>If you are interested in being a TA for CS 11 for next term, contact the
CS 11 instructors <a href="mailto:mvanier@cs.caltech.edu">Mike Vanier</a> and
<a href="mailto:donnie@cs.caltech.edu">Donnie Pinkston</a> as soon as
possible.  The exact number of TAships and the exact number of hours per TA
are not determined before a term starts; it depends on the enrollment
figures.  It is most likely that we will need TA support for the C and C++
tracks, so expertise in at least one of those languages is a major plus.  You
do not have to have taken CS 11 to apply, nor do you have to be a CS student.
However, we would like some evidence of your coding abilities, preferably in
the form of coding samples.  Teaching experience is also a big plus.</p>
