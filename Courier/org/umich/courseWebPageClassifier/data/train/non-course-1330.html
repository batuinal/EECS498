<p><a href="#Funding">You must go to the&nbsp;</a><a href="#Welcome_Meeting">Welcome Meeting</a>&nbsp;to find out all about independent work. This is a mandatory meeting, even if you have previously done independent work, since the logistics change from year to year.</p>

<p>You&nbsp;<a href="#Finding_a_Research_Advisor_&amp;_Research_Topic">must find an advisor</a>&nbsp;as soon as possible.</p>

<p>AB students are required to do a thesis in their senior year. BSE students are not required to do a thesis, but can do a thesis, or can equivalently do 2 consecutive semesters of independent work for which you receive a single grade (you'll temporarily receive an "incomplete" on your transcript in January, which will be filled in with the correct grade in May.) I'll refer to AB's doing theses, BSE's doing theses and 2-semester IW projects all simply as "thesis writers" -- everyone who does this will have the same requirements and deadlines. The deadlines and requirements for single-semester work are different. See information on BSE thesis writers for more information on that option.</p>

<p>You should also read all the information on this page and be thoroughly familiar with it. Do not miss sign-ups for your presentations or talks! Do not hand in checkpoints late! Make note of the the list of&nbsp;<a href="/ugrad/independent-work/dates-deadlines">important dates</a>. It is your responsibility not to miss a deadline.</p>

<p>A note to sophomores: If you are majoring in COS, you may sign up for 398 as a sophomore and do an IW. Normally, however, this will count simply as a course and will not satisfy your IW requirement. In particular, for AB students, this will just be another course for you, and will not exempt you from any of the IWs that you need to do during your junior and senior years. For BSE students, you will not be able to use IW done sophomore year to satisfy your one-course IW requirement for the BSE program.</p>

<h2>Important Dates and Deadlines</h2>

<p>Everyone should know the important dates and deadlines. The dates and deadlines are somewhat different for thesis and single-semester independent research.&nbsp;<a href="/ugrad/independent-work/dates-deadlines">See this page</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="Finding_a_Research_Advisor_&amp;_Research_Topic" name="Finding_a_Research_Advisor_&amp;_Research_Topic"></a>Finding a Research Advisor &amp; Research Topic</h2>

<p>Your number 1 priority BEFORE the start of the semester&nbsp;is to find an advisor and a topic you will enjoy working on. Picking your advisor and topic as early as possible and getting started on work cannot be emphasized strongly enough. Please see this website for ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.cs.princeton.edu/index.php/UgradResearchTopics">Independent Research Projects and Faculty</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Faculty will be updating this web page with new research ideas all the time. Also check out web pages and research project pages for faculty who you know or have taken a class from.</p>

<p>During the course of the semester, you should be meeting regularly with your advisor and updating him/her on your progress. <u><em><strong>Setting up a schedule to meet your advisor every single week of the semester, at the same time, is highly recommended. </strong></em></u>Failure to meet with your advisor will almost certainly cause you to get behind schedule and could even cause you to fail the course if you do not make good enough week-by-week progress. As a rule of thumb, try to allocate 6-10 hours of time per week for progress on your independent work project.</p>

<p>It is possible to do interdisciplinary work involving CS and another field. Any interdisciplinary project must have a significant computer science component, but if it does, you may want an advisor from a department other than computer science. For example, the projects and faculty link above also lists non-CS faculty who have done research with CS students in the past or are looking to do interdisciplinary projects with CS students in the future.</p>

<h2><a id="Welcome_Meeting" name="Welcome_Meeting"></a>Welcome Meeting</h2>

<p>At the beginning of each semester we will have a meeting to explain the key requirements, reinforce the dates and deadlines for the semester, and give some resources for how to find projects, advisors, and research areas in the department. See the&nbsp;<a href="/ugrad/independent-work/dates-deadlines">important dates page</a>&nbsp;for the place and time of the meeting.<a>&nbsp;Come, eat pizza, and find out how to do a successful independent work project.&nbsp;</a>Attendance is mandatory. Dates and requirements change from year to year.</p>

<h2><a id="Proposal_Presentations" name="Proposal_Presentations"></a>Proposal Presentations/Progress Reports</h2>

<p>Everyone must sign up and give a research proposal/progress report presentation. 2-semester projects and thesis projects will give one proposal presentation at the beginning of the Fall term (they will not give another one at the beginning of the Spring term). Single-semester independent work projects will give a proposal/progress report presentation towards&nbsp;the beginning of the semester. This presentation will come in approximately the 4th or 5th week of the semester. See the&nbsp;<a href="/ugrad/independent-work/dates-deadlines">important dates page</a>&nbsp;for the sign-up deadline and the dates for giving presentations. Sign-ups will occur via WASS. You are expected to sign up for one slot&nbsp;and&nbsp;attend all of the talks in that 1-hour time block (starting and ending on the hour). While attending you will fill out feedback forms. You will give the forms to the other students in your group to give them tips that will help them improve their speaking abilities.</p>

<p>You will be given 9 minutes for the talk and 3 minutes for questions. An absolute maximum of 12 minutes from when the last person finished to when you finish. If your talk is too long you will be cut off in the middle -- manage your time carefully! You must upload your slides to the dropbox prior to the talk -- see the&nbsp;<a href="/ugrad/independent-work/dates-deadlines">important dates page</a>&nbsp;for the exact webpage, etc.</p>

<p>Please make your presentation in either PowerPoint or PDF formats. Part of (not the entire presentation) may involve giving a demo of some software you have created or are using.</p>

<p>Please read the section on&nbsp;<a href="#Giving_Good_Research_Talks">giving a good talk</a>. Also, be sure to&nbsp;practice in advance, by yourself and if possible to your friends,&nbsp;and to&nbsp;go over your talk with your advisor. Your advisor will be able to give you good feedback on both the content and the style of presentation. You will be assessed on both the proposal content and the clarity and effectiveness of your presentation. You should not assume that the audience has a specialized knowledge of your field. Assume your audience is a group of senior undergraduates from Princeton who have not necessarily taken the courses that are most closely related to your research area.</p>

<p>In general, a reasonable format for this talk would be something along the following lines:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Title slide</strong>. Include your name, class, project title, and advisor.</li>
	<li><strong>Problem Description &amp; Motivation</strong>. Give a high-level introduction to the research area in general and state specifically what problem you will be researching. Explain why the area and specific problem is important, interesting and nontrivial to solve. Give the audience some reason to keep listening to your talk. In other words, theMotivation&nbsp;is a critical part of any successful research talk. The motivation is not "I need this to graduate," but instead should be something like "this problem commonly arises in picking hockey players for your NHL hockey pool, and a better algorithm could improve your chances of winning the pool". Giving some examples will make the problem easier to understand in general. Using pictures or graphs to explain your ideas is often a very good idea -- feel free to use lots and lots of pictures and have very little writing on your slides. Many excellent research talks are composed almost exclusively of pictures and graphs. But then again, don't go overboard. If using pictures is not the best way to make your point then don't. Use common sense and judgment at all times.</li>
	<li><strong>Problem Background and Related Work</strong>. You probably are not the first person to work in this area, nor will you be the last. Give some background of what has been done. Have academics already written papers on this topic? What do those papers contain? Why will your research be different? Have industrial researchers or companies already built related software? How will your software be different? It is always the case that&nbsp;someone&nbsp;has done&nbsp;something&nbsp;that can be related to what you are going to do. Find out the most closely related pieces of work and explain the relationship to your proposed research.</li>
	<li><strong>Progress to date and plan of attack.</strong> Explain, as clearly as possible, what steps you have taken and plan to take to solve the problem. What papers will you need to read? What mathematics will you need to learn? What algorithms will you need to define? What software infrastructure will you need to build (pictures can help explain the software architecture)? What work have you already done? What data sources will you need to obtain to perform effective experiments? Outline any logistical or technical problems you anticipate and explain any contingency plan you have for avoiding or coping with them.&nbsp;Give a realistic timeline and set deadlines&nbsp;for completion of subtasks.</li>
	<li><strong>Evaluation and success criteria</strong>. At the end of the project, you should have some means of measuring success. Explain what you hope to achieve, and how you will quantify/qualify it. What experiments will you do to prove that your ideas are successful?</li>
	<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>. Sum up the most important aspects of the talk concisely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that each of these bullets may require more than one slide. Please do not feel constrained by the number of slides, but make sure you stay within the time limits. Your slides should be reasonably attractive, visually -- use graphics where appropriate to explain the problem, etc. Most presentation programs have some pre-packaged slide backgrounds, etc., that have reasonable color/font schemes for text, bullets, etc. You should probably use them but&nbsp;do not use an overly-gaudy background that distracts from the content of your slides.&nbsp;Remember that the&nbsp;content&nbsp;of your slides is the most important part of this talk. The&nbsp;presentation&nbsp;is meant to enhance it, not mask any weakness in content. At the same time, presentation is important -- a good format uses color, font size, etc., to show organization and to make it easier for the viewers to follow your presentation.</p>

<h2><a id="Giving_Good_Research_Talks" name="Giving_Good_Research_Talks"></a>Giving Good Research Talks</h2>

<p>Giving a good research talk is much harder than you might think and also probably much more important than you might think. No matter how smart you are or how hard you work you will not become a great scientist until you can communicate your ideas effectively. To improve your presentations, you should practice them, both alone and in front of others, before giving it during your allotted time slot. And take feedback on your posture, eye-contact, style and energy seriously as well as the structure, organization and content of your talk. You should imagine that the audience you are attempting to communicate to is a group of senior Princeton undergraduates in computer science. Since they are Princeton seniors, they are smart and have quite a bit of knowledge about computer science in general, but will not know the specifics of your particular research problem or area. Therefore, you need to introduce the problem and the reason you are doing your research clearly. You cannot depend upon your audience knowing specific jargon, nonstandard mathematics, the nuances of particular programming languages or the specifics of certain software packages. You also need to be a bit of a salesman or saleswoman -- you need to convince your audience that your ideas are useful or intriguing or ingenious or astonishing. You want to try to leave your audience impressed by what you have accomplished and hoping to hear more about it at a later time. If your talk depends upon research or results done by other people then, as usual, you need to cite those other people or papers or software products in your talk.</p>

<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk-slides.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a>&nbsp;is a talk about how to give talks. Here is a video of Simon Peyton Jones&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wit.at/events/peyton-jones/giving_a_talk.ram" target="_blank">giving the talk</a>&nbsp;on how to give talks (Needs RealPlayer v10). Note that this talk is about how to give a talk after you have done a bunch of research. At the proposal stage, you are not expected to have done too much research, so there will be a greater focus on explaining the nature of the problem area, why the problem is important or intellectually interesting and who else has done research on this problem in the past. Instead of saying what you&nbsp;have done&nbsp;you will say what you will do and, importantly, how you will evaluate it. However, be sure to revisit this example of "how to give a talk" before giving a final presentation talk (for thesis writers).</p>

<p><a href="http://iw.cs.princeton.edu/13-14/affliates-pads-may05.ppt">Here</a>&nbsp;is a talk David Walker gave to Princeton's industrial affiliates. Your talk will be shorter, but this is a good example of a research talk. Notice that slides 2-15 explain that there is lots of "ad hoc data" but no standard programming tools to manipulate it easily -- that is&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;the PADS technology will address. Slides 16-22 describes what research was done&nbsp;-- it describes the main components of the PADS system; it gives pictures to describe the software architecture; it shows (some of) the results of using one of the PADS tools. Slide 23 explains some&nbsp;future research.&nbsp;Slides 24 and 25&nbsp;recap and conclude. Once again, this talk was given after a bunch of research was done. It is probably a better guide for the final presentation talk than the proposal/progress report, but I hope it helps you see the general style of a research talk.</p>

<p><a href="http://iw.cs.princeton.edu/13-14/nextbill.ppt">Here</a>&nbsp;is another example talk created by Vivek Pai, aimed at a broader audience.</p>

<p>You are heavily encouraged to ask your advisor to take a look at your slides in advance and to take their suggestions for improvement seriously.</p>

<h2><a id="Checkpoints" name="Checkpoints"></a>Checkpoints</h2>

<p>Both thesis writers and single-semester IW researchers must prepare&nbsp;checkpoint documents&nbsp;twice a term. See the&nbsp;<a href="/ugrad/independent-work/dates-deadlines">important dates page</a>&nbsp;for exactly when. The purpose of the checkpoint document is to make sure that everyone is making good progress on their research and will be able to complete their project by the deadline. We hope no one will fail their independent research project. However, students that do not make progress throughout the semester and do not complete satisfactory research can and will fail this course.</p>

<p>Preparing the checkpoint document is not supposed to be difficult or take much of your time. All you must do is write approximately a one-page document that clearly explains what you have accomplished so far. The checkpoint should be divided into three parts (1) Progress to Date: Mention any ideas you have had, software you have built, related research you have evaluated and papers or textbooks you have read. (2) Current difficulties: If you are having difficulty making progress on your project due to some obstacle, explain the obstacle and a plan for overcoming the problem. (3) Next steps: Detail how you anticipate proceeding for the rest of the term.</p>

<p>To get credit for preparing each checkpoint document you must do two things:</p>

<p>1. You must have a meeting with your advisor in which they read your document and fill out &amp; sign your thesis midpoint form (<a href="/sites/default/files/pages-files/IW%20Checkpoint%20Form%20August%202014%20%28Revised%29.pdf">form is here</a>). Naturally, you can e-mail your advisor your document and have them read it in advance of your meeting if you want.</p>

<p>2. You must return the signed form to the UGC&nbsp;by the deadline&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href="/ugrad/independent-work/dates-deadlines">important dates page</a>).</p>

<p>Notice, it is your job to&nbsp;return the signed form to the UGC by the deadline. That means you have to write your document&nbsp;in advance of the deadline&nbsp;and arrange to have a meeting with your advisor&nbsp;in advance of the deadline.&nbsp;You will be penalized for turning in a form late. However, there is no penalty for turning in a form early!</p>

<h2><a id="Poster_Session" name="Poster_Session"></a>Poster Session</h2>

<p>Every independent work student will produce a "poster" or poster-like display for the final poster session. The poster session is typically held in the&nbsp;Friend Center Convocation Room.&nbsp;There will be one poster session in January for Fall independent work students and one poster session in May for Spring independent work students.&nbsp;See the&nbsp;<a href="/ugrad/independent-work/dates-deadlines">important dates page</a>&nbsp;for exactly when and where the poster session will be held.</p>

<p>Poster Logistics: Usually, each student will have 1 side of a bulletin board that is 4ft by 4ft to mount their display. Most people will have conventional posters as displays. However, we encourage students to come up with new and creative ways to communicate the intellectual content of their theses to other students and faculty. Thumb tacks for mounting conventional posters will be provided for you. If you are considering something unconventional, please check with the UGC and IWC&nbsp;well in advance&nbsp;to determine if the idea is feasible. In general, space is limited so while creative ideas are wonderful, they need to fit in the same space as a conventional poster presentation.</p>

<p>Poster Spiel: During the poster session, various faculty and other students will walk from poster to poster. When a faculty member or student arrives at your poster, you should be prepared to give them a clear, interesting, 3-minute explanation of your project. Think of it like a miniature, informal presentation. Your spiel should be well structured: introduction (set the context, explain the main goal of the research) followed by technical details of how it works (what did you build? what did you prove? what was the interesting tricky bit that will catch people's attention?) followed by any results (experimental data, demo, proofs) followed by related work, future work and a conclusion. You don't have to have such a spiel memorized. In fact, it is often better not to because it will seem more natural. However, it is useful to think about and practice what you might say.</p>

<p>Poster Content:&nbsp;During the poster session, faculty and students will wander from poster to poster and engage you in conversations about your research. Therefore, each poster should be created in such a way that best helps you explain the intellectual content, importance, creativity, and overall "coolness" of your IW project to a faculty member or student&nbsp;working outside your area of research. Like a good research talk, you should start any conversation with a faculty member with a high-level explanation of the&nbsp;basic problem&nbsp;you are solving and why it is important. Once the faculty member understands the problem, you should move on to explaining the most interesting elements of&nbsp;your solution&nbsp;to the problem. After explaining the basics of the solution you can move on to discussing any&nbsp;experiments or proofs&nbsp;you have done to&nbsp;evaluate&nbsp;or validate your ideas. Do not be afraid to explain negative results in which experiments showed that your ideas did not necessarily pan out as you thought they might. Sharing negative results is a part of good science. Remember that like in a good talk, pictures, graphs, and charts are often worth 1000 words. Also remember that like a good talk, a poster presentation must bepracticed&nbsp;in order to be effective. Give practice presentations to your advisor and your friends. Have your friends try to think of difficult questions for you to answer in the middle of your presentation so you are prepared. You should be ready to give a 3 minute presentation, a 5 minute presentation or a 15 minute presentation to a faculty member who walks by. Give me a punchy 3minute spiel on why your work is great. Other faculty will only visit a subset of the posters and will spend more time with each presenter.</p>

<p>Example Poster: Here is an&nbsp;<a href="http://iw.cs.princeton.edu/13-14/sosp03poster.pdf">example of a poster</a>. Here is&nbsp;<a href="http://iw.cs.princeton.edu/13-14/SamplePoster.pptx">another example of a poster</a>, this time as a PowerPoint file so you can use it as a template that you can edit to include your own content. However, you do not need to emulate the style; these are just examples.</p>

<p>Demos: If you would like to do a demo of your project, you may bring your own laptop as well as your own stool (or stack of boxes or other contraption) to support your laptop next to your poster. Note that demoing your software does not replace the need for you to create a poster. If you need power, or want to do some kind of more elaborate set up of devices, you should check with the IWC and UGC to get their opinion as to whether it will work... Space is the main constraint during the poster session. We will do what we can to make your ideas work. However, we do need some advance warning. If you have creative ideas, please consult with us via email&nbsp;prior to the demo scheduling deadline&nbsp;(the&nbsp;<a href="/ugrad/independent-work/dates-deadlines">important dates page</a>). If you do not send us email by the deadline, we may not have space and/or be able to give you access to power or other things you need in the Convocation Room.</p>

<p>Printing posters.&nbsp;WARNING: Don't wait until the day before to figure out how to create and print your poster -- you will be out of luck! No excuses about being unable to create a poster on time will be accepted. It is your responsible to figure how to do it and get it done on time. Here are some options for creating posters:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Simple I: Print out a series of slides and pin them up individually to the 4ft by 4ft bulletin board that will be provided for you. Surrounding each individual slide by colored construction paper looks good.</li>
	<li>Simple II: Print out a series of slides and glue or tape them on to poster board. Pin up the single poster on your bulletin board.</li>
	<li>Large-Format Printers: Create a single large PDF or PowerPoint slide with all the information you want on your poster&nbsp;<a href="http://iw.cs.princeton.edu/13-14/sosp03poster.pdf">like this one</a>&nbsp;and print it at one of the large-format printers on campus. One option is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/printing/" target="_blank">Print Services</a>, who have a large-format printer and student pricing. Another option is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/prism/info/poster-printing/" target="_blank">PRISM Poster Printing</a>&nbsp;but they fill up quickly in the few days before the poster session.</li>
	<li>FedEx Office (Kinkos), Triangle, etc (or other commercial copying facilities): Often have facilities for printing posters, but tend to be expensive, in the $50-$100 range.</li>
</ul>

<p>Awards: One additional goal of the poster session is to help the faculty identify award-caliber independent work. Awards may be given out for the best Senior Thesis and best Junior and Senior Independent Work as well as the best Demo or best Poster.</p>

<h2><a id="Grading" name="Grading"></a>Grading</h2>

<p>Grades for independent work will be determined by assessing</p>

<ul>
	<li>the creativity, originality, thoughtfulness and impact of student ideas</li>
	<li>evidence of research skills including analysis of research literature, the ability to learn new techniques and ideas individually, the ability to accomplish research tasks, the ability to adjust to unforseen obstacles during the course of research</li>
	<li>the quality, impact and originality of the project results</li>
	<li>the content, clarity and polish of presentations, including proposals and the poster session</li>
	<li>the content, organization, clarity, quality and writing of the final report</li>
	<li>time management skills and on-time execution of checkpoints, presentations and reports</li>
</ul>

<p>Final grades will be determined jointly by the adviser, any second readers (for thesis writers) and the IWCs. Additional Computer Science Department faculty may read student final reports and help assess presentations and posters.</p>

<h2><a id="Funding" name="Funding"></a>Funding</h2>

<p>AB students can apply for their iw project/senior thesis research funding by accessing the online application in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/studentfunding/">Student Activities Funding Engine (SAFE)</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BSE students will receive an email from the SEAS Engineer School regarding funding at the beginning of the semester.</p>
