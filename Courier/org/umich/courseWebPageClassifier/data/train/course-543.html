        Welcome to CS106L!
      </p>
      <p>
        CS106L is offered as a companion class to <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106b">CS106B</a>/<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106b">CS106X</a>
        which offers a more complete exploration of the C++ language.
        The class will include a quick overview of the fundamentals of C++, and then progress on to cover more advanced C++ concepts.
        We'll also spend some time learning about the ecosystem that C++ lives in, learning about modern tools like Boost and C++11.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lectures meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:15-5:05 PM in 370-370.
        There are no exams, and grades are entirely based on three programming assignments (which you only have to do two of!).
        The class is designed with a student who has taken or is currently taking CS106B/X in mind, but there are no formal prerequisites.
      </p>
      <p>
        CS106L will be using an IDE called QT creator for lecture examples as well as assignments. To install QT creator, follow this <a href="http://stanford.edu/~rawatson/qt/installation.html">Installation Walkthrough</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
