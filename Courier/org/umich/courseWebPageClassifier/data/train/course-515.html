<h3>Course Summary</h3>

<p> This is a course about the practice of programming, an attempt to
expose students to the development of real programs.  Programming is
more than just writing code.  Programmers must also assess tradeoffs,
choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance,
and maintain software written by themselves and others.  At the same
time, they must be concerned with compatibility, robustness, and
reliability, while meeting specifications.  Students will have the
opportunity to develop these skills by working on their own code and
in group projects.

<P> During the first half of the semester, there will be a programming
assignment each week, which should take perhaps 5-6 hours to complete.
During the second half of the semester, students will work in groups of
3 to 5 on a project that will involve a substantial amount of design and
implementation.

<P> COS 333 is about programming, not about a specific language.  The
course will assume that you are very familiar with C and Java, and will
include excursions into a variety of languages like shells, Awk,
Python, Javascript, C++ and Go.  There will be significant emphasis on
tools, both how to use them and how they are designed and built.
Students must be comfortable with C and Java programming and with Unix,
and able to write modest-sized programs that work.  <b>COS 217 and 226 are
prerequisites.</b>

<h4> Syllabus: </h4>

This syllabus is always subject to change.
Each topic will take roughly one week; there's no guarantee
that we will cover all of them, nor in any particular order.

<P>
<ul>

<li> regular expressions, grep, shell
<li> scripting languages: shells, Awk, Python, others
<li> web systems: HTTP, CGI, HTML, CSS
<li> Javascript, DOM, Ajax
<li> web frameworks, development environments
<li> databases; network plumbing 
<li> graphical user interfaces
<li> object-oriented programming, C++, STL
<li> component-based software: .NET
<li> APIs, design patterns
<li> etc. (maybe)

</ul>

<P> This is meant to be more than a laundry list, however.  Each
section will also discuss issues of design, implementation, testing,
performance, portability, and other software engineering concerns, and
these will also be part of the programming assignments.  With luck
there will be a handful of guest lecturers as well.


<P>
There is one required text:
 <a href="http://netlib.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop">The Practice of Programming</a>,
by Kernighan and Pike; you should also know basic Unix tools and usage
as described in, for example,
 <a href="http://netlib.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/upe">The Unix Programming Environment</a>.
Other readings will be posted.  The books listed in this <a
href="bib.html">bibliography</a> are also worth looking at; they cover a
wide variety of material related to programming.

class size, I may set up regular office hours once things get rolling;
alternatively, send mail to make an appointment, or just drop in if my
door is open, which it usually is.

<a name=assignments><H4>Assignments:</h4></a>

<P> Half a dozen programming exercises will be assigned during the first half
of the term; each is intended to take about 5-6 hours, but is sure to
take longer unless you are careful.

<p> Assignments are together worth about 30-35 percent of the course
grade.  Assignments are generally due by
 <b><font color=red>midnight on Fridays</font></b> 
unless there are extraordinary circumstances.  For the record,
<b>extracurricular activities and heavy workloads in other classes don't
count as "extraordinary"</b>, no matter how unexpected or important or
time-consuming.  Assignments will generally be posted on Tuesday and due
at midnight on Friday 10 days later.  This leaves enough time that we
will not be able to grant extensions except in case of documented medical
or other serious issues.

<a name=late><P> If you submit your work late,</a> we will give you credit 
for it on this scale:
<ul>
<li>    95% for work submitted up to 3 hours late,
<li>    90% for work submitted up to 6 hours late,
<li>    85% for work submitted up to 12 hours late,
<li>    75% for work submitted up to 24 hours late,
<li>    50% for work submitted up to 48 hours late,
<li>    0% for work submitted more than 48 hours late.
</ul>

<h4> Project: </h4>

The second half of the semester will be devoted to a group project.  The
project can be done with whatever combination of languages and
techniques makes most sense; one of the goals of the project is to
encourage careful tradeoffs among alternatives, and planning of
interfaces to minimize dependencies among components.  The project is a
good place to explore personal interests further than can reasonably be
covered in class.

<P> The project will have frequent checkpoints along the way for which
you will have to prepare status reports, preliminary designs, and the
like.  There will be a public presentation and demo at the end, a
written writeup, and submission of a system for testing and
evaluation.  All of these are graded.

<P> The project will be worth about 60-65 percent of the course grade;
it will be shared equally among group members, with the possibility of
negative adjustments for members who fail to contribute their fair
share.

<P> You must complete all assignments and project requirements to pass
the course.  Furthermore, the class is so large that we don't have the
resources to nag and make special arrangements; you are responsible for
meeting all the requirements without reminders.



<h4> Attendance: </h4>

Attendance and participation is potentially worth up to 10 percent of the course grade.
Attendance is mandatory; unexcused absences will be penalized.

<P> <table bgcolor=yellow><tr><td>
<P> <blockquote><b> Regular class attendance is required and class
participation helps.  Unexcused absences are grounds for a failing grade
regardless of other performance.  This means you.</b></blockquote>
</td></tr></table>


<h4> Laptop Policy </h4>

<P>Please, <a href="doonesbury.gif"><b>no laptops, phones or tablets
except for taking notes and other class purposes</b></a>.  
Regrettably, computers and phones appear to be primarily used for email,
chat, YouTube, Twitter, Google, solitaire, poker, eBay, Facebook, and
similarly compelling diversions, all of which distract you, your
neighbors, and me.  (Additions to this list are welcome; I can't keep
up.)



<h4> Collaboration Policy for Assignments: </h4>

(This policy on collaboration in assignments is adapted from the COS
217 web page.)  Programming, like composition, is an individual
creative process.  Individuals must reach their own understanding of
the problem and discover a path to its solution.  During this time,
discussions with friends are encouraged.   However, when the time comes
to write the code that solves the problem, such discussions are no
longer appropriate -- the program must be your own work (although you
may ask teaching assistants for help in debugging).  If you have a
question about how to use some language or operating system feature, you
can certainly ask your friends or the teaching assistants.  The course
newsgroup is also intended for sharing insights on the meaning of
questions, terminology, and so on.


<P> <STRONG>Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's
program for an assignment</STRONG>.  Writing code for use by another
person or using another person's code in any form violates the
University's
 <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/pub/rrr/part2/index.xml#comp24">academic regulations</a>.


<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior for assignments include:

<ul>

<li>Copying any part of another person's program into your code.  The
only exception here is code given to you in the assignment directories
or explicitly approved in the assignment.

<li>Working or collaborating with another student after either of you
has started writing code.

<li>Consulting or using assignment solutions from any previous offering
of this course.

<li>Helping another student to do any of the above.

</ul>

<p>The program you turn in must be <strong>your</strong> work.  You may
get help from the instructor or a TA after you have started writing code,
but not from other students.  Computer science assignments are not like
physics or math problem sets: there is no single right answer.  Each
student is expected to come up with his or her own individual solution.

<p>If you plan to do something that you are not absolutely sure is
legal, <strong>ask first</strong>.  Ignorance of this policy will not be
accepted as an excuse for your actions.

<P> You are responsible for ensuring that your files are not readable by
your classmates.  We recommend doing your COS 333 assignments on your own
machine or in a private subdirectory, i.e.:
<PRE>
	% mkdir cos333
	% chmod 700 cos333
</PRE>

<h4> Collaboration Policy for Projects: </h4>

Projects will often use open source code and other publicly available
material as building blocks or as the basis for modification and
adaptation.  This is permitted and indeed encouraged, but such code must
be properly attributed, and the project as a whole must be substantially
your own work.  Please consult with the instructor if you are uncertain
about a proposed course of action.

<P> Project groups are encouraged to share insights and information
about how things work, how to get things done, and other aspects of
programming knowledge.
