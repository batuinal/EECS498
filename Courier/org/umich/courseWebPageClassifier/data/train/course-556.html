Computer Science 249A: Fall 2014 (3 units)<br>
TTh 11:00-12:15, Thornton 102 (also broadcast on

<h1>Object-Oriented Programming from a<br>Modeling and Simulation Perspective</h1>
<p>
This course examines object-oriented programming techniques and issues,
emphasizing programming as modeling and simulation, and covers the role of
programming conventions, style, restrictions, and design patterns
to leverage object-oriented programming for programming-in-the-large.
</p>
<p>
The objectives of the course include to cover issues involved
in developing large-scale object-oriented software systems,
to show how programming style conventions and language restrictions can ease
object-oriented software development, and to provide insights
into software component interface design.
</p>
<p>For more background information,
see the <a href="ad.txt">email</a> message sent in the past
to advertise the course.</p>
<p>Students will design and implement simulations in C++,
applying the techniques covered in the course.
You may develop your C++ code on any machine with a modern C++ implementation
(must support C++11 language features), but you should test your code
on one of the Stanford corn machines (corn.stanford.edu)
because we will evaluate assignments on these machines.</p>
<p>
There will also be a midterm exam in class on Thursday, October 23, and
the final exam will be on Wednesday, December 10 from 7:00-10:00pm.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Prerequisites: Knowledge of C/C++ and programming methodology as developed in CS 106B or 106X, and 107.

<h4>Collaboration</h4>
<p>
Under the
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpsa/judicialaffairs/guiding/honorcode.htm"
>Stanford Honor Code</a>, each of you must submit your own work
in this course.  However, we expect you will ask others
(instructor, CAs, other students) for hints and debugging help, as well as
discussing problem-solving and program-structuring techniques.</p>
<p><b>We encourage you to collaborate with others, but we require
that you indicate on your assignments any assistance you received</b>.
You are also responsible for understanding and being able to explain
the work that you submit.</p>
<p>Any assistance not cited may be considered a violation of the Honor Code, and
suspected violations of the honor code will be investigated and referred to the
Board on Judicial Affairs.
Honor code violations are a serious matter, and being found guilty of one
can ruin your academic career.  Please review the
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpsa/judicialaffairs/guiding/honorcode.htm"
>honor code</a>. If you ever find yourself uncertain about
how it applies to your situation, please ask.
Asking what you might think is a silly question is
better than risking your career.</p>

<h4>Late assignments</h4>
<p>
Each student has 5 24-hour extensions to use for late projects.
No more than 3 extensions can be used for any single project.
</p>
<p>
Lectures are made available via SCPD on the same day they are taped,
so SCPD students are expected to follow the same schedule
as the rest of the class. This means that the above late assignment policy
applies to SCPD students as well; exceptions are not granted
due to students' work obligations.
</p>

<h4>Incomplete policy</h4>

<p>No incompletes can be given in this course. Please make sure
you determine before the drop deadline whether you can complete
the course satisfactorily.</p>
