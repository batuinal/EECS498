<p>Hello everyone! Here are the extra hours for Project 1:<br/>
Friday from 5-7pm in CIT 201 (Jess) <br/>
Saturday from 6-8pm (Jake) and 8-10pm (Miles) in CIT 201<br/>
Sunday from 8-10pm in CIT 227 (Joe)</p>

<p>In addition, Joe will continue holding his regular office hours on Sunday from 4-6pm in CIT 227. All these changes will be reflected on the course <a href="calendar.shtml">google calendar</a>. Good luck with the project!</p>

</div></div>
<p>Hiya everyone! As you might expect, the snow day messed with our schedule a little bit. We will have updated course resources to reflect these changes by the next class (2/3). In the meantime, <strong>the only thing you need to know is that HW 1-2 is now due on February 3rd.</strong></p>

<p>If you have not turned in the collaboration policy, <strong>please do so as soon as possible</strong>. You can bring them into TA hours, scan and email it in to us or bring it to the next class. We can not grade your homeworks until we've received a signed policy.</p>
