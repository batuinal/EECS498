<p>The practical component of the class, in particular the programming
parts of the homework assignments, will be carried out in Matlab.
It is by far the most commonly used language in machine learning
research community
today, as well as in other, related fields of research such as computer vision or signal
processing. It is also increasingly common in industry. Because of that, there is a vast amount of code
available on the Web, with excellent implementations of many learning
algorithms.</p>

<p>Matlab is a high-level scripting language; one does not have to declare
variables, define types or explicitly deal with memory allocation and
pointers. There are also excellent built-in visualization tools. So,
it is very easy to quickly develop and debug implementations of
relatively complicated algorithms, without being bogged down in gritty
coding details. Matlab is easy to use, and if used
properly, it can be very powerful and efficient, although of course it has its
limitations. The main trick is to understand the idea of
"vectorizing" everything; as a rule, any operation that can be expressed in terms
of vector or matrix operation will execute very, very fast.

<p>If you have not previously worked with Matlab, you may find it
helpful to go over this <a href="MatlabTutorial.html">Matlab
Tutorial</a>. The TAs will also provide help with learning Matlab, as
necessary.

detail than you will probably need.</p>
